<p class='c009'>Our every footstep treads upon a grave! The keel of the
snowy-pinioned vessel but turns a fleecy furrow while plowing
its way over the abodes of death. Earth is but one vast
tomb, where sleep, side by side, commingling their dust, the
king and peasant, the master and slave, the beautiful and the
repulsive. Beneath the iron-clad feet of our swift steeds—beneath
the thunder-rush and lightning speed of engines—beneath
the quick, firm tread of business men, and beneath the
gentle pressure of the daintily-slippered feet of lovely women,
lie the mouldering form—the dust of stalwart men and the
more delicate clay that was fashioned by the Master hand into
childhood, girlhood, womanhood—beauty. We turn from
scenes of busy life, and enter the deep forest, unthinking and
careless that beneath our footsteps lie the mouldering bones
of the war-painted warrior, beside his broken spear and stringless
bow; and, in another place, the dusky forest-maiden, who
once wreathed amid the dull blackness of her hair the gorgeously-tinted
buds and blossoms of the God-cultured prairie.
But so it is. The star that leads civilization westward shines
sadly upon the graves of a people almost extinct—a people
that have been hunted ruthlessly from their greenwood haunts
till every year has seen their graves multiplying thicker and
thicker in the wilderness. Then the Anglo-Saxon comes to
plow it up and plant corn above the dead warriors, stooping
now and then to pick up a stone arrow-head from his furrow,
and examine it curiously, as if he did not know what soil his
sacrilegious plow was upturning.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>The Indian sees his council fires flicker out one by one,
scarcely rising skyward long enough to gild the ruins of his
bark and skin-covered wigwam, or light up the ashes over his
deserted altars.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yon star that leads westward has no halting-place for him
till it sets on the calm Pacific, writing on its blue waters the
history of a people that have perished.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a lovely morning. The sun rose from its nightly
course, radiant with beauty, kissing the dew from the tiny
cups of the myriad flowers, tinging with gold the emerald
leaves of the forest, and gilding the crests of a thousand little
billows that were just waking to life in the shaded pools of the
mountain streams. It was a scene of wondrous loveliness—a
scene that the eye might willingly rest upon forever, while
the soul drank in its freshness till satiated with the very
excess of beauty. A scene like that the pen or pencil of man
are impatient to portray. The Master Artist—God! upon the
canvass of his own created world, has alone written it out.</p>

<p class='c010'>Under one of those picturesque clumps of trees that broke
the luxuriant monotony of the rolling grass-land, a corral of
covered wagons had been drawn up for the night, and now
stood with the canvass swaying in the breeze, circling a snowy
little tent which had been pitched against the trunk of a noble
tulip-tree, and stood beneath its deep-green branches like a
great white bird rested on the grass.</p>

<p class='c010'>The little camp had formed itself late the night before, and
the deep breathing of many a stalwart sleeper came from the
covered wagons, while the guard kept his post yet, but with a
weary fall of the body and a wistful look at the wagons; for
he envied the sleepers there with all the earnestness of a tired
man.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the midst of the stillness, the covering of the pretty white
tent began to flutter, as if the great bird it represented so
much were stirring its plumage; first one curtain was lifted,
then another, and after a little peeped forth one of the most
beautiful faces you ever set eyes on—only the more beautiful
because her hair, black as a crow’s plumage, hung in great
undulating waves down her shoulders, just as she had dropped
it, half-braided, when tired of holding its weight in her
small hands. It was a radiant face, rich with health and fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>coloring. Her brown eyes—sometimes black when she was
excited, but of a warm, loving brown now—cast a bright glance
out upon the morning, the curtain fell again, there was a fluttering
motion of life within the tent, then all the canvass was
flung back from the front, and as queenly a young creature as
you ever saw stepped out upon the trampled sward. In form
and face the girl was something wonderful to look upon; and
now that her hair was coiled in a raven braid around her
head, and her figure was clearly defined by a close-fitting dress
of richly-toned calico, there was an air of high breeding in her
carriage singularly at variance with the scene around her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some clusters of wild blossoms grew within the circle of the
wagons still untrampled and pure. She saw them drooping
heavily beneath a rain of dew, and going up to them, swept the
drops off with her hands, thus taking a morning bath which
was half moisture, half perfume.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now,” she said, looking around upon the green undulations
of the prairie, “now for a straggle among the flowers.
One never gets a lonely walk when we are on the move. I
am tired of being forever cautioned to keep close to the
wagons. Now for the prairie. How the green waves rise and
swell to the morning wind. It is like launching forth on an
ocean. It seems as if one could swim through the grass.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Esther Morse—this was her name—ran back to the tent and
brought forth a pretty straw hat, very coarse, but so garnished
with crimson ribbons that it had a look of dainty sumptuousness,
which she carried away by the strings. Thus she left
the camp, singing as she went, but in a low voice that harmonized
with the gush of bird-songs that swelled through the
morning.</p>

<p class='c010'>Esther passed the almost sleeping guard, who, tired with
his night of watchfulness against the prowling Utes, was
leaning noddingly upon his rifle. She flashed upon his sight
rather as some visitor from starry climes than that compound
of earth we call woman.</p>

<p class='c010'>“’Tain’t my business, Miss Esther,” he muttered, more to
himself than her, “but who knows what red-skins may be
a-watchin over behind them rocks yender.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never fear for me, Abel Cummings,” replied the girl
cheerfully and with a sweet smile upon her face; “I only want
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>to take a short walk in the grass. Never fear for me, I will
be back long before breakfast is ready.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If ever thar was an angel thar goes one,” soliloquized the
man as she passed him.</p>

<p class='c010'>And on she rambled, far beyond the usual limits prescribed
by camp regulations. Well might a poetic fancy be lured by
such a scene. The cloud-crowned caps of the Wind River
Mountains loomed ghost-like in the rare, blue air—the sloping
prairie around was green in its spring freshness—the foliage,
that marked the river’s tide, glitteringly bright, and the just
rising sun throwing over all its rare and delicate sheen of
golden-vermilion. These before, and above, and around;
while behind, the tented wagons dotted the greensward, looking
as if a fairy caravan had encamped in a new Eden.</p>

<p class='c010'>Careless of all danger—thinking but of the glorious scene
around her, Esther Morse stepped rapidly over the rolling
ground and soon was lost to sight. Now and then she paused
and stooped to examine some dainty bud, and then, as if anxious
to make the most of her time, pressed forward again. The
plash of swiftly-running waters greets her ears, and soon she
stoops over the sparkling tide which came surging over a pile
of rocks. Well might she look in the pool below. Such rare
beauty was never mirrored before in that sylvan looking-glass;
the foot of a being so fit to be the sovereign of the scene never
before trod the mossy brink. She cools her brow with the
spray, and the foam-beads flash amid the blackness of her
luxuriant hair. She bends still more closely over the silvery
tide, and can almost count the snowy pebbles beneath. A
bird flits by and she listens to its song for a moment, but to
send back a reply still more sweet. An antelope stays its
rapid course for an instant, upon the opposite bank, to gaze
upon her with its pensive eyes, ere its hoofs, swift almost as
light, ring a merry chorus as it speeds away, buoyant with
innocent life. Truly it is a bower of beauty—a very paradise
in the far distant wilderness. The spirit of evil should indeed
forbear to set his foot or leave his serpent trail in a place like
that.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hark! Like the aroused stag, her ear is bent to listen.
She holds her breath and stands poised for flight. Is it the
wind playing idly among the branches—the stir of her father’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>train preparing for their onward march—the rush and thunder
of the buffalo herd, or the stealthy tread and long, shambling
gallop of the gaunt, gray wolf? Is it the step of some one
sent in pursuit of her—some one to guard her against danger—or—and
the very thought sent a thrill of fear quivering
through her entire frame—is it, can it be the wily savage
seeking for plunder, prisoners, perhaps scalps?</p>

<p class='c010'>Little time did she give herself for thought, but with a
quick, startled glance around she turned to go; but with the
first step confronted an Indian girl standing in her very path.
To pass her and rush to the camp before the red warriors
could cut her off from the way, appeared to be her only hope;
but even as she hurried past, the skirt of her dress was caught
and retained, while a not unmusical voice whispered, in
strangely broken accents:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look. Me no enemy to you. Look! Has the pale-face
no thought of the Laramie? The memory of the white squaw
is not true like the heart of the red one.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In a moment the swiftly-retreating blood flowed back to
Esther’s heart. She recognized the Indian girl as one whom
she had slightly befriended weeks before.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The white squaw good to me. She has no forgotten?” asked
the Indian girl, or rather wife, for she was in fact the bride
of a dusky chief of the Sioux.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the bright sunlight, as she stood there waiting to be
recognized, this Indian woman was the very incarnation of
that rare, almost spiritual beauty sometimes to be found among
the daughters of the red-men. Slight, yet tall, with movements
so perfectly graceful that they approached those of a
leopard; with a small foot, whose richly-ornamented moccasins
fell light, almost, as the dew upon the prairie-blossoms;
with long, black hair, knotted with scraps of gorgeous ribbon,
she stood before Esther. Her eyes, large, lustrous and pensive
as those of the antelope, were fixed upon the young girl. You
would not have thought, from the expression at the moment,
that they could be piercing as the sun-gazing eagle, when
insult or danger aroused the slumbering passions of uneducated
nature. With that look, and a voice flute-like and musical,
it would have been strange indeed if she could so soon have
been forgotten.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>“Yes,” replied Esther, “I remember you well; but what
could have brought you so far from your tribe? You Indian
women are not used, I think, to stray away from your wigwams
or leave your husbands.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Waupee has no husband,” was the response of the young
wife.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No husband! What do you mean? It is not a month
since I saw you the bride of a great warrior—high in power
and famous on the hunting-path.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“One day there came to the wigwam of the Black Eagle
a woman fair as a white rose. The warrior forgot Waupee,
his wife, and his heart turned to the white rose. Waupee has
no husband.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Waupee—White Hawk—what story is this? What do
you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The warrior can not see the moon when the sun is showering
its golden arrows to the earth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why talk to me in this ambiguous manner? Speak
plainly, so that I may understand.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Black Eagle of the Sioux has feasted his eyes on the
beauty of the pale-face.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“On me? You can not mean me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The tongue has traveled the trail of truth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But it is folly—madness! He will never see me again.
I shall soon be forgotten, Waupee, and then all will be well
with you again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The red-man never forgets.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you have traveled so far—so many long miles, to tell
me of this—to tell me that—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The wigwam of Waupee is desolate.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you must have had some other motive. It can not
be this alone could bring you so far.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let the daughter of the pale-face bend her head so low
that Waupee can whisper to her. The woods have ears, the
flowers hearken, and the trees drink in words.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What mystery—what new fear is this? Tell me quickly,
for my heart leaps wildly in terror of some danger that you
know of.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“<em>The Black Eagle of the Sioux is flying swiftly upon the trail
of the pale-face he would have for his mate!</em>”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>“Horror! Even now he may be concealed between me
and my father’s camp. Thanks, thanks, good Waupee, and—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hark!” and the Indian woman laid her ear close to the
ground and listened for some time in silence. Then rising,
she continued: “The earth is thundering beneath the hoofs of
swift-running horses, but they are still afar. Let the daughter
of the pale-face hasten to her people, and never again let her
moccasin wander. The eye of the Black Eagle is keen, his
wings swift, his talons sharp, and his heart knows neither pity
or fear.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you, Waupee?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Great Spirit directs me. The poor Indian woman
has risked her life to save you, for you were kind to her. But
now—” she started suddenly as if serpent-stung, and without
another word disappeared in the thick undergrowth.</p>

<p class='c010'>Left to herself, the white girl paused but for a moment—a
single one, as if to consider her nearest and most secure path
to the camp, then darted off, with the swiftness of a frightened
deer. Now and then she listened intently, while pausing to
gather breath, and once, in passing, bent over the swift-running
water that washed the green grasses and tiny flowers at her
feet, attracted, even in her flight, by some unwonted object.</p>

<p class='c010'>Was it the eyes of a basilisk that so enchained her? What
was the form, but half hid by the drooping bushes, that robbed
her cheeks of their healthy red and brought a cry of anguish
to her quivering lips. Do demons lave their black limbs in
the limpid waters of the mountain streams, or forms Plutonian
sport where the salmon should alone flash its silver sides?</p>

<p class='c010'>The waters parted with a turbulent dash, and a dark form
arose, dripping like a water-god, before her. It was Black
Eagle, of the Sioux.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ugh!” The arms of the Indian were extended, his eyes
flashed with the fires of savage triumph. He gathered her
up from where she stood white as death and frozen with fear,
and, as a hawk seizes rudely on its prey, bore her off.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>“Abel Cummings, what are you a-doing there, my good
man? Come, be stirring;” and the speaker issued from a
large wagon near at hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Doin’, Squire? Only lookin’ out to see if I could see any
thing of Miss Esther. But it ain’t of no use, for she’s gone
clear out of sight,” replied the man, addressing the owner of
the train, and the father of the wandering girl.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You might be in better business than spying after a runaway
girl. Let her go. Hunger will soon bring her back
again, I’ll warrant. So stir around—wake up the men, and
have every thing ready for a start.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But, Squire, they say that thar’s lots an’ lots of Indians
a-skulkin’ around, and who knows but that they may carry
Miss Esther off and—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eat her up, I suppose!” interrupted the parent, with a
hearty laugh.</p>

<p class='c010'>Checked in his speech, the man turned sullenly away, and
in the bustle of the hour had soon forgotten his fears. So,
indeed, it was with the majority, if they had in fact any curiosity
about a young creature who had always been accustomed
to wander at will and without restraint. But, careless
as the father apparently was, he often turned his eyes in the
direction pointed out by the man, and grew more and more
troubled that she did not return.</p>

<p class='c010'>Strange, very strange it would have been if that father
had not been anxious, for she was all that remained to him
of a beloved family. Wife and sons had fallen victims to
the terrible reaper of the scythe and hour-glass, as he
swept in a fearful epidemic through the land. This beautiful
daughter was now his sole idol. Heart-sick, he had turned
his back upon the place of his birth—gathered up his means,
and, following the westering star, had determined to make
for himself a new home in the regions “where rolls the Oregon,
and hears no sound save its own dashings.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>The breakfast-hour arrived and still the girl came not; passed,
and she had not appeared. The time of starting was delayed,
until a feeling of intense uneasiness—a vague sense of danger,
took possession of every heart. Anxious eyes were strained
prairie-ward, but in vain. No flutter of dress or springing
step told of her coming. Once, only, moving life appeared in
the distance: they saw a troop of horse sweeping over a far-off
eminence—wild horse they must have been, for none bore
riders. For one moment they flashed before their eyes, floundering
madly on, and then were lost in a cloud of whirling
dust, which alone told of their passage.</p>

<p class='c010'>Simple as the incident was, they remembered it well in
the hereafter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Saddle up your best horses, boys!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The order came with startling sternness, for the heart of
that poor father was now sorely troubled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Abel Cummings, lead the way. You saw her last, and
should be a sure guide.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Waal, Squire, yes; but, yer see—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Silence! This is no time for words. Action, man,
prompt and decisive action may save my child; nothing else.
A hundred silver dollars to him who first brings me news
of her. Mount and forward! Mount all, except those who
guard the wagons. Mount and—”</p>

<p class='c010'>A little cloud of dust, scarcely larger than an infant’s
hand, arose suddenly in the distance, whirling in eddies aloft,
and checking further speech, for in those regions slight causes
often produced events of the most startling character. Who
could tell that this little cloud of dust might not be caused
by the hoofs of a savage band, resolved on robbery, if not
murder!</p>

<p class='c010'>Without waiting for commands, the circular line of the
corral was again formed, the cattle and horses secured within,
and each man, fully armed, at his post. Then every eye was
turned upon the prairie, eager to learn what the cloud might
portend.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nearer, still nearer, it came, as if lightning were trailing
its red flashes along the earth, searing the foliage as it passed
and leaving only a train of whirling dust behind. Nearer
it came, and soon the beating of each heart was less fitful,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>and every rifle was dropped from its poise. Nearer—still
nearer, and two horsemen came bounding up the slope,
“bloody with spurring, fiery red with speed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The foremost—for his good steed, though held in check,
came many lengths ahead—was mounted on a horse of great
power. With the exception of a single snowy spot in his
forehead, the superb animal was black from hoof to fore-top.
He cleared the earth with great, vigorous bounds, his thin,
open nostrils red as coral, his head matchless in its symmetry,
ears delicate and pointed, and tail and mane waving like
twin banners in the breeze. With a firm, yet light hand, the
rider controlled his slightest motion, and guided him at will.
When he had reached the corral, and the rider flung himself
carelessly to the ground, there was not a quivering of the limbs
or heaving flank to tell of the rapid race he had just finished.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who and what are you?” demanded Miles Morse, as the
new-comer glanced around and appeared to take in the entire
scene with a single look, while every eye was riveted upon
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Well might these men gaze upon the new-comer both in
admiration and surprise, for a more superb specimen of the
Western hunter and border scout never trod the earth. More
than six feet in height, with long black hair, and a thick
beard sprinkled with gray, an aquiline nose, and eyes piercing
and restless as the eagle’s, he was a man well worth remembering
as a noble specimen of the class.</p>

<p class='c010'>His dress was the usual picturesque costume, formed
mostly of doeskin, curiously fringed and embroidered. His
hat was the true slouch—“rough and ready,” with a gold
band glittering around it. He held a long rifle in one hand,
while pistols and a knife bristled defiantly in his belt. As he
stood stroking the arched neck of his good horse, you saw
the very <em>beau ideal</em> of that pioneer race who, scorning the
ease and fashionable fetters of city life, have laid the foundation
of new States in the unexplored regions of the giant
West, and dashed onward in search of new fields of enterprise,
leaving the great results to be gathered by the settlers
that come slowly after him. There he stood, leaning against
his horse, lithe as a panther, fearless as a poor honorable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>man may well be after he has, companionless, traversed the
trackless desert, and fought the grizzly bear in his own fastnesses.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who am I, stranger?” he said, with something like a
smile. “May be you have heard of Kirk Waltermyer?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Waltermyer? I think I have heard your name before.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Heard of me, stranger? Why, I am well known from
the pines of Oregon to the chapparel of Texas. Ask La
Moine, there, if we haven’t danced at every fandango, hunted
in every thicket, and trapped on every stream.”</p>

<p class='c010'>His companion, whom he had called La Moine, was a tough
and wiry specimen of the half-breed Frenchman, so often
found among the north-western hunters and voyageurs—a
man of but few words, but true as steel to a friend, and implacable
in his hate of an enemy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I have heard of you,” continued Morse. “I remember,
now, and was expecting to find you somewhere in the
vicinity of Salt Lake. I was told you could guide me by the
best route to the Walla Walla valley.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I guide you!” and the weather-bronzed man laughed in
a reckless and heart-whole manner. “I guide you? Why,
stranger, I could do it blindfolded.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I believe you, but we’ll talk of it another time.
First, let me ask what brought you here?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, my good horse—the best-limbed, swiftest, surest
horse on the perarer. None of your mustangs, that, stranger,
but a full-blooded cretur, worth his weight in diamonds.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know that; but your business? From what I learned
about you, this is not your usual trail.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Waal, it hain’t, that’s a fact; but some of the skulkin’
followers of that devil-worshiper, Brigham Young, ukered
me out of nigh a hundred head, and I’m not the man to play
such games with, sure as you live.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hundred head? What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ha! ha! Waal, you must’er come from the tother side
of sunrise. Head? Why, cattle, to be sure; but they didn’t
steal them, for they knew my rifle had a rayther imperlite
way of speakin’ its mind, so they bought them and have
forgot to pay.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“I understand. And now, listen to me. My daughter
wandered away from the camp early this morning and has not
returned. I fear that—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“La Moine,” interrupted Waltermyer, somewhat rudely,
while the cheerful expression of his face changed into a frown
as black as a thunder-cloud, and his entire nature appeared
to have assumed a stern purpose, “La Moine, do you
remember the red rascals we saw dashing over the perarer
like so many frightened wild horses? I told you thar was
something wrong—that some traveler had lost his stock or
something worse had happened. Which way did the girl take,
stranger?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There—toward the timber.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And some skulkin’, thievin’ savage was lyin’ in ambush
for her, I’ll bet a dozen beaver-skins. La Moine, go with—who
saw her last—you, man?—well, go with him and see if
you can find the trail.” As the Frenchman departed, accompanied
by Abel Cummings, he continued: “Ef thar ever was
a man that was part hound, had the hearing of a deer and the
cunning of a fox, thar he goes;” and he stripped the heavy
saddle from his horse, took the bit from his mouth, and
allowed him to graze at will.</p>

<p class='c010'>A half-hour—which appeared very long to the watchers—and
the two men returned.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Waal, La Moine?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The girl has been carried off, Waltermyer, that’s sartin.
But one Indian did it. Thar is the print of another moccasin,
but it is a little one—that of a squaw. I should say that the
white gal and the squaw had been talkin’ together, and after
they had separated, some Indian devil of a warrior jumped
from an ambush—dragged the gal inter the stream and across
it—found his braves waitin’, and after lifting the gal inter a
saddle, off they went like so many black thieves.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ef you say so, it is so, and I’ll swear to it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We saw a troop of horses in the distance,” said the father,
“but as they had no riders, thought they must have been wild
ones. No, no! they could never have carried Indians.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not them!” replied Waltermyer, “not them! Why,
man, any boy that ever saw a perarer could have told you how
it was. They were hiding behind their horses—with only one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>foot thrown over the saddles, if they had any at all, while
the girl was bound down and kept on the further side. It’s
too old a trick to fool any one. But which way were they
going, the prowlin’ wolves carryin’ off young lambs? West,
were they? They will strike for the South Pass; but what in
the name of common sense should take them thar with a
stolen girl?”</p>

<p class='c010'>No one appeared competent to solve the question, and all
was silence until the Frenchman—for so he habitually called
himself, notwithstanding his Indian blood—whispered in the
ear of Waltermyer the single word “Mormons.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Right, man! Right for a thousand slugs! Stranger, did
you come by the way of Laramie?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly, we stayed there a number of days.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“War thar any followers of the holy prophet—as the infernal
sinners call themselves, though I call them thieves—around?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A large train. We left them there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And they saw your girl?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Every day. Several of them visited us. One in particular
came often and appeared very anxious to converse with us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What sort of man was he?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Large, rather good-looking, and a plausible and gentlemanly
appearing man.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“With black hair, as smooth as my colt’s skin, and a scar
on one cheek?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes. I remember it distinctly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know him, stranger.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You! But that is not improbable.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll bet my rifle I do, and a bigger Satan never disgraced
the name of man. He’s a hull mule train in rascality, that
man is. It isn’t the first of his infernal capers that I have
been knowing to, and unless you travel swift you may make
up your mind to find your daughter in that serpent’s nest,
Salt Lake City.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Heaven keep her from it! Death, even, would be a blessing
compared to that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Amen to that, stranger, and ef you had seen and knew
as much as I do you would say it with your hull heart.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What can be done to save her Waltermyer? She is my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>only child—all that is left to me. You will help a father in
his worst troubles? Go with me—help me and name your
price—any thing, all, I possess shall be yours, if you save
her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stranger, I will go. Thar’s my hand on it, and though I
say it who shouldn’t, it’s just as honest a hand as thar is on
the frontier, and never yet took money for a kindness.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know it—I believe it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then don’t talk to me of pay. Kirk Waltermyer ain’t
no Digger Indian, or yaller greaser to take blood-money. If
thar is any thing, stranger, that would have kept me from
lendin’ you a helpin’ hand it is that same offer to pay.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Forgive me and forget. Trouble—this terrible trouble,
should outweigh my mistake.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And so it does. Besides, you didn’t know any better.
You men who are brought up in cities and have your souls
cramped up between brick walls—who buy and sell one
another like horses, don’t know what it is to live out human
freedom on the perarers—to enjoy life—to be <span class='fss'>MEN</span>! But we
are losin’ time. Let half a dozen of your best men mount
their swiftest horses, arm themselves to the teeth and follow
me. La Moine, you stay, guide the train to Fort Bridger and
wait thar until you hear from me. Every hour we can gain
now is worth a day to us. Come, stranger, don’t get downhearted.
Kirk Waltermyer will see your girl righted or thar
shall be more howlin’ and prayin’ in Salt Lake than Brigham
Young ever got up at one of his powows.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The words were scarcely out of his mouth before he had
whistled his horse to his side, saddled and bridled him, flung
himself on his back, and was dashing away with the perfect
grace and horsemanship of an Arapahoe. Rude as he was in
speech and manner—unlettered and unrefined—a purer diamond
never yet was concealed in any man’s breast than the
heart of Waltermyer.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 id='CHAPTER_III' class='c003'>CHAPTER III.<br> <span class='c008'>THE APOSTLE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The followers of Joseph Smith, the martyr to his own
fanaticism, were traveling slowly, like the Israelites of old,
from their ruined homes in Illinois to the far-off Salt Lake.
On the night in which our story deals with them, they had
pitched their tents for the night on the grassy banks of the
Sweet Water river. Before them loomed up Independence
Rock, like some castellated tower of feudal times—grand,
hoary, grim and picturesque. Beyond was the “Devil’s Gate,”
through which they would soon have to pass. A strikingly
appropriate name this for the passage that was to usher them
to the valley of the “Saints” beyond! He who named it
must have been gifted with prophetic wisdom with regard to
the people who were to travel it in after days.</p>

<p class='c010'>The scene was attractive, even beautiful, for these people
wandered like the Patriarchs of old, with flocks and herds,
pitching their tents in the wilderness. The last rays of the
sun struck with slanting light the canvass homes, tinging them
with dusky gold. The cheerful hum of busy labor rose healthfully
on the breeze. The song of the maidens while milking
the cows—the prattle of little children—the gay laughter of
young people and the tones of manly voices swelled together—an
anthem of toil. Bright fires were already sending their
smoke on high, wreathing in fanciful coils and drifting through
the air, tinged with a glorious brightness like thunder-clouds
when the sun strikes them. Busy mothers bent over the coals,
preparing the evening meal, while their husbands wheeled the
heavy wagons into a circle, and formed a temporary fort, calculated
to protect them from attack from without, and stampede
within. The air was soft, and the clouds mottled, dolphin-like,
changing as the sun went down into deeper hues
of crimson, gold and purple. The trees were aflame—the
swiftly-running stream, molten silver—the burning death-fires
of the day had flooded the earth with evanescent brightness.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>“Showered the maples with celestial red;</div>
      <div class='line'>The oaks were sunsets—though the day was dead;</div>
      <div class='line'>The green was gold—the willows drooped in wine;</div>
      <div class='line'>The ash was fire—the humblest shrub divine;</div>
      <div class='line'>The aspen quivered in a silver stream.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Amid all this loveliness, selfish passions were at work, striving
for their own ends, with a deluded people toiling on to
erect a molten calf in the wilderness to be worshiped in the
place of the true God!</p>

<p class='c010'>But the smoke of the evening fires became thin, and faded
away; the glowing coals died out amid the whitened ashes.
The children, innocent as yet, thank Heaven, had passed into
the sweet dreams that infancy alone can know, and the elders
gathered to hear the mockery of an evening service, to profane
that almost holy solitude with the idolatry of a purely sensual
religion.</p>

<p class='c010'>The master spirit rose, the beguiling serpent who had lured
these ignorant men and women from their quiet homes in the
old world, and desecrated the quiet of that lovely evening
with his pointless ravings—inflammatory pictures of the
“promised land” that should soon dawn upon their longing
eyes; all the blasphemous teachings of a wily brain.</p>

<p class='c010'>A man, subtle in his nature and in his speech—with a
superfluity of words, and gifted with the low cunning of an
adroit impostor, he yet was looked up to as one on whom the
sacred mantle of “the prophet” had fallen. Practice, and his
own nature had enabled him to assimilate himself with the
peculiar ideas of those he wished to influence—to lower himself
to any level, and cunningly use it for his own selfish ends
and personal aggrandizement.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nature had done much toward enabling him to become the
living lie he was. In youth his figure had been fine and his
face attractive; and though years had told upon the one, rendering
it somewhat coarse, and evil thoughts had plowed
unmistakable furrows upon the other, enough of early grace
and manly beauty remained to enforce the iniquity of his
doctrines.</p>

<p class='c010'>With great unction and show of reverence his discourse
was delivered; the sweet strains of the evening hymns rolled
forth, echoed by the rocky reverberations of the grand old hills
afar off; the smouldering fires were extinguished; the guards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>placed, and silence settled down upon the shores of the Sweet
Water.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Elelu Thomas—for so the prophet was named—had no
inclination for sleep. His tent had been pitched apart from
the others, and with little difficulty and no fear of observation
he could make his way from the corral into the open prairie.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alone, if one filled with evil thoughts can ever be alone,
he sat for a long time. No sweet memories gathered around
his heart and thronged the mystic cells of the brain. No
tender recollections flashed, fairy-footed, through the halls of
thought, but unholy fancies alone had power with him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” he muttered, between his closely compressed lips;
“Yes. The plan will work to a charm. Never yet has a
human soul escaped me. This shall be the master-stroke of
my life. Hark! No, no, it is not what I long to hear. It
is but the half-suppressed song with which the sentinel cheats
the long hours. But it is so near midnight—the poor fools
who have so blindly followed and given me their gold are
asleep—dreaming, perhaps, of the bright valley I have so often
told them of. What a waking there will be soon! Well,
well, it is necessary to keep up the delusion, and I would be
but a fool like them to kill the goose that lays my golden
eggs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man opened a trunk upon which he had been seated,
took out some arms, and cautiously left the tent. He crept
stealthily through the wagons, skirted along them, half hid by
the shadows, and gained the woods unobserved.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Rare sentinels these,” he thought. “To-morrow I will
teach them a lesson that they will not soon forget. But here
is the spot, and—”</p>

<p class='c010'>A touch upon his arm caused his cowardly soul to leap to
his lips, while a deep voice whispered in his ears:</p>

<p class='c010'>“The pale chief watches not well the stars.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah! Black Eagle, is that you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The red-man has been waiting. When the moon first
touched the tops of the trees he was to be here. It’s light is
now creeping down the trunks.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I know I am late, but now that I am here tell me
how you have succeeded?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Has the pale-face forgotten his promise?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>“No; here is the gold; the rest you shall have at the
proper time. Now, about your mission.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He who would keep should watch also. When the fawn
wanders far from the horns of the buck, the wolves are soon
on its trail.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, yes; but tell me plainly what you mean.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The eye of Black Eagle is keen, his arm is strong and his
horse swift.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Bah! with your Indian circumlocution. Tell me about
the girl, man. Have you got her?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is mourning and blackened faces in the wigwam
of her tribe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have carried her off then?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“As the eagle of the mountains does the young dove of the
valley.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you brought her here? Here? Where is she,
man?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not like the children of the prairies can the pale squaw
ride. She is feeble as the little pappoose, and her heart is sick
as the snake-charmed bird.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What of it?” and a dark frown settled on the face of the
speaker. “Why did you not bind her to a horse and bring her
here at all hazards? My people would have tended her as—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The wolf the lamb.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A strange speech that, to come from a nomadic, red warrior,
and the eye of the white man quailed under  the fiery
glance fastened upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, yes, something like it,” he replied, trying to conceal
his feelings under an unpleasant laugh. “But where is
the girl?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the lodges of the Sioux.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I must see her this very night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Has the pale-face become a child? Is he a woman, that
he forgets the thoughts of yesterday, and would, like the serpent,
sting itself to the death.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no. I had forgotten the plan for a moment. She
is safe, you say?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“As the beaver in the iron-tooth trap.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And her father knows nothing of the trail—who carried
her off—when or where?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>“The red-man leaves his footsteps in the running water;
It rolls over them and they are gone.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Keep watch of her, then, as you would guard the very
apple of your eye, for she is to my heart as the ‘rose of
Sharon and the lily of the valley.’” The old hypocrisy
would break out from his impious lips, and the deception of
a lifetime found utterance even when his soul was unmasked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The lodge of the red-man is as safe as the log war-house
of the pale-face.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, you know the plan. In the roughest part of the
cañon—even in the ‘Devil’s Gate,’ as the children of the
world call it, I will be prepared to rush down upon you
and rescue her. She will be grateful, for her heart is warm
and loving. Be sure you are at the appointed spot at the
right time, and then—”</p>

<p class='c010'>He had half turned away from his companion, and on
looking for the Black Eagle again, found himself alone.
Silent as had been the coming of the Indian was his departure.
With a mind filled with conflicting emotions, the impostor
turned back again toward the encampment. Very
little faith had he in the fidelity of Black Eagle, for his own
treacherous heart made him suspicious of others, and this,
added to the well-known character of the red-man, made him
fear the result. Reaching the corral in safety, he crept
through the barricades made by the wagons, and was soon
sleeping calmly as the most innocent child in the encampment.
Looking on that man, you might have fancied that
some angel’s prayers had showered poppy leaves around him,
and some kind hand had held to his lips a balmy nepenthe
against all the trials, cares and passions of life.</p>

<p class='c010'>When guilt sleeps, then let the pure in heart rejoice. But
what a strange anomaly it is, when an evil nature can throw
off its corroding fetters—its whirlwind passions, debasing
influences, and slumber like untainted childhood—that even
the most depraved can for a time change the entire current
of their lives, and, touched by the leaden wand, become oblivious
of their own wickedness. “To the pure, all things are
pure,” and a very paradox it is that sin, when slumbering,
can throw off the crushing millstone and wander like innocence
joyously among the roses.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>The Indian, when he had secured the gold of his infamous
patron, and noiselessly departed, struck at once into the middle
of the stream, and dropping into the current, swam
leisurely down, till he reached the shadow of an overhanging
rock. Here he drew his lithe form cautiously up, shook the
water from his garments, and then plunged into the thicket.</p>

<p class='c010'>His savage nature had mapped out the path he was to
follow, and no meddling fancies were allowed to intrude upon
him. A double purpose he had in view—gain, and the
gratification of his own selfish purposes. The tenets of his
savage religion offered no bar to their accomplishment, and
he knew quite as little of conscience as his employer.</p>

<p class='c010'>An hour later, and just as the sun was lighting the fleecy
clouds, and all nature sung its first song of praise for the
coming day, Black Eagle emerged from the forest, many
miles distant, and entered the camp of his followers.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='CHAPTER_IV' class='c003'>CHAPTER IV.<br> <span class='c008'>CLAUDE AND ELLEN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The great West has its villas and palaces now crowding
out the log-cabins of thirty years ago. You find them sheltered
superbly by the ancient forest-trees, and surrounded by
velvet lawns, through which the wild prairie-flowers will
peep out and make an effort at their old free blossoming, but
only to be uprooted for the hot-house roses and fuchsias of
other climes.</p>

<p class='c010'>In one of these luxurious dwellings lived the La Clides,
the most refined and wealthy family to be found in the
neighborhood of St. Louis. The owner, a young man, not
yet four and twenty, and his mother, one of the most beautiful
women of her time, occupied this noble dwelling, and the
vast wealth which had been left to their control was day by
day expended in making it still more beautiful.</p>

<p class='c010'>Claude La Clide’s grandfather had been a French fur-trader,
when western enterprise of this kind yielded enormous profits.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Like many of his class, he married among the Indians, choosing
for his forest-bride a daughter of the Dacotahs, as the tribe
loved to call itself, or more commonly in their savage relations,
Ochente Shacoan—the nation of the Seven Council
Fires—though by the white traders they were designated as
Sioux.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fur-trader soon accumulated a fortune in his profitable
traffic, and having buried his Indian wife in the forest, took
his only child, a daughter, back to St. Louis to be educated.</p>

<p class='c010'>There La Clide invested his money in real estate, which
rapidly rose in value, and, almost without an effort or a wish,
he became one of the richest men of the West. While his
daughter was in her first youth, the fur-trader died, leaving
her his great wealth in direct possession.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two years after her father’s death, a young French gentleman,
impoverished and exiled for his participation in one
of those revolutions which are constantly scattering the old
families of France into strange lands, came to St. Louis. He
was a man of peculiar refinement, handsome and modest as
refined men usually are. He met the young heiress. Her
beauty, the shy, wild grace inherited from her mother, softened
and toned down by education, fascinated him at once. She
was something so fresh, so unlike the females of his own
world, that her very presence was full of romance to the
young exile. She loved him and they were married.</p>

<p class='c010'>La Clide brought all his taste and knowledge of architecture
into action, when a new home for his bride was built near the
town, and yet removed from its bustle and crowds. It commanded
a fine view of the monarch river, whose eternal flow
could be heard from the veranda and balconies when the day
was quiet. Its stone walls were soon draped with the choicest
climbing plants. Passion flowers twined in and out through
the stone carvings of the balconies, roses curtained the windows.
Great forest-trees waved their branches over the roof,
and clothed the distant grounds, and above all, love reigned
within—that quiet, deep love for which a man or woman is
so grateful to God that it breaks forth in thanksgiving with
every smile and word.</p>

<p class='c010'>But not even love can stay the black-winged angel. He
came one night when the first tinge of silver had crept into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>the husband’s brown locks, found the mysterious mechanism
of the heart diseased, and gently stopped its beating. So,
without one sigh or word of farewell to the beloved wife
slumbering by his side, he passed away.</p>

<p class='c010'>Never was grief so sacred or so quiet as that which fell
upon the mistress of that residence when she found herself
alone, the guardian of a young son, and a widow forevermore.
She had been a proud woman in married life—proud of her
husband, proud of her beauty for his sake, and, oh, how more
than proud of his noble son, her only child. The fiery Indian
blood that ran in her veins, and gave that splendid brunette
complexion, was no bar to her reception in society with the
people of St. Louis, for an intermarriage with the Indians had
been no uncommon thing with the first settlers, and in her
the savage blood was so graced with refinement that it was
forgotten even by the new-comers, who had begun to bring
their prejudices beyond the great river.</p>

<p class='c010'>But enterprise and civilization, as it concentrated in the
neighborhood, had sometimes shot its poisoned arrows at this
noble woman, and a shrinking thought that there might be
something in her Dacotah blood to wound the pride of her
son, or impede his generous ambition, had silently taken force
in her nature.</p>

<p class='c010'>But there was nothing in this to disturb her position as a
leader of society. In her husband’s lifetime his house had
been the center of all that was intellectual and of worth in
society for miles and miles around. A genial hospitality had
won the talented and the good to his roof. The widow permitted
no change in this. All that her husband had thought
right became a religion with her. All that he had been, all
that he had enjoyed, should reappear in her son.</p>

<p class='c010'>Was it wonderful that she almost worshiped the young
man as he grew so like his father in expression and voice, so
like herself in the rare beauty of his person?</p>

<p class='c010'>Five years of widowhood, and this idol of her life had
become perfect in his manliness. The raven hair of his
grandmother, but softened, finer and glossy, fell in thick
waves over his forehead. The tall, lithe form, erect and
graceful, the eagle eye, the proud poise of the head, were
splendid in their regal beauty; while the soft, olive-tinged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>skin, warmed by the flashing blood of his transatlantic father,
the tender light that sometimes filled his eyes, the blush that
flushed his pure forehead, were perfect in their blending of
refined and savage beauty. Just enough of the wild grace
and <em>insouciance</em> of his Indian ancestry had been mingled with
the pure blood of the old French nobility to render this young
man strikingly beautiful in person and most alluring in mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>La Clide’s physical education had been perfect. A more
fearless horseman could not be found, even in his grandmother’s
tribe; yet, in the dance he was quiet and graceful, his walk
remarkable only for its stately ease. Like his person was
that proud, tender and fiery nature. No frown could swerve
him from the right, no allurements win him to the wrong.
He neither gave offense nor brooked insult. Love, with him,
was a sacred passion; women, creatures that stood half way
between him and the angels, not worth winning save by aspiration.
And this man was in love. That pure, strong heart
had been given away blindly, as such hearts will sometimes
go from their own keeping. He had been accepted, and was
now betrothed.</p>

<p class='c010'>One spring evening, when the perfume came sweetest from
the balcony which opened from his mother’s sitting-room, the
young man came in from the city. Springing from his horse,
he tossed the bridle to an attendant, flung his whip after it,
and entered the house. The moss-like carpets smothered the
sound of his heavy footsteps, or the mother must have guessed
at his agitation before he reached her.</p>

<p class='c010'>As it was, Mrs. La Clide sat quietly amid the cushions of
her easy-chair, reading. Even in his passion, the young man
paused a moment to regard her; with those surroundings she
broke upon him so like a picture of the old masters. The
walls of that room were lined in every part by richly-bound
volumes that gleamed out richly in the first twilight. Near
the broad sashes that opened into the balcony, two statues, a
bacchantic and a graceful dancing-girl, were holding back the
frost-like lace of the curtains, allowing the light to fall on that
calm face, surmounted by its coronal of braided hair.</p>

<p class='c010'>Was he mistaken, or did that face look paler than usual?
Was it pain or thought that drew those beautiful brows
together?</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>This anxious thought held the anger with which he had
entered the house in abeyance. He stepped forward.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mother!”</p>

<p class='c010'>She started and dropped her book, pressed one hand suddenly
against her heart, and gasped out:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, my son.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you reading? Have I frightened you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Reading? No, I only held the book. One falls into
thought sometimes, forgetting every thing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>La Clide took up the volume she had dropped. It was a
medical book, and had fallen upon the floor open at a treatise
on diseases of the heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, mother, what is this?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That? Oh, nothing. It chanced to be on the table.
But what is the matter? You look strangely, Claude.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do I? Very likely, mother, for I come to tell you that
I can never marry Ellen Worthington.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My son—my son! Another lover’s quarrel—is that all?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is no lover’s quarrel. But she is heartless—my wishes
are nothing to her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Heartless, dear Claude. I think you do the girl wrong.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, mother. She treats our engagement as if it were a
spider’s web, to be swept through with a dash of her hand.
Not an hour ago I saw her in the most public street of St.
Louis, leaning on the arm of that miserable gambler, young
Houston.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no. It can not be so bad as that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Worse than that; she was hanging lovingly on his arm,
while he bent and whispered—yes, mother, whispered in her
ear.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. La Clide seemed surprised; but she was a good
woman, too good for hasty conclusions. She thought a
moment, and answered her son gently.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ellen may be giddy, my son. That is a fault of youth,
and she is young. But I think—I am sure she loves you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She loves the wealth I have, and the position we can
give her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now you are harsh, Claude.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Harsh? No woman trifles with the man she loves.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, dear; sometimes in mere thoughtlessness.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>“But when her fault has been more than once pointed
out?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps you have not done it with sufficient gentleness.
We are sometimes haughty in our demands without knowing
it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are kind—very kind, mother. All this would console
me if I did not know how resolutely Ellen has persisted in
disregarding my wishes—if I did not know that she has
attempted to conceal her intimacy with this man from me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is this really so, Claude?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Would I make the charge if it were not true?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Worthington!”</p>

<p class='c010'>In their excitement, the mother and son had not heard the
colored waiter, and his voice startled them when he announced
the very person they were talking of.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Show her in here,” said the mother, seating herself, and
again pressing a hand to her side.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man retired, and directly a light voice and the flutter
of a pretty muslin dress came through the outer room.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where are you, my beautiful mamma that is to be? Oh,
Claude, I did not expect to find you here,” cried the golden-haired
beauty, turning her deep blue eyes upon him. “Wait
one moment, while I kiss your mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Down she fell upon her knees, winding one arm around
Mrs. La Clide, and holding up her rosebud mouth for a kiss,
which the elder lady gave her very gravely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There, now!”</p>

<p class='c010'>She started up, drew the perfumed glove from her hand,
and held it toward him, glowing from its imprisonment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What, you will not take my hand?” she cried, turning
away to use the hand in smoothing the braids of her hair.
“Never mind; it isn’t a butterfly, to settle twice in the same
spot;” and, with a careless movement of the head, she ran
for a cushion and sat down at Mrs. La Clide’s feet. “Oh, my
sweet, black-eyed mamma, how I have longed to see you,”
she said, in a sweet, caressing whisper.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have always been at home to you, Ellen,” was the
somewhat cold reply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I have been so busy. Claude, I say, angry yet?
What is it all about?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>She held out her hand again, glancing at him a little
anxiously from under her long lashes. No ordinary man
could have withstood that look, the creature was so lovely in
her rich health and graceful position.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t be cross, Claude. Only think, I haven’t seen you
in three whole days. How can you treat me so cavalierly?”
she pleaded, a little frightened by his persistent coldness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Still, I passed you in the street but little more than an
hour ago,” was his grave answer.</p>

<p class='c010'>The color fluttered unsteadily over her face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed? I did not see you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I presume not. You were occupied.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Was I? Oh, dear, yes—I remember. I happened to
meet Mr. Houston. He was telling me of—”</p>

<p class='c010'>She caught the force of those large black eyes bent upon
her, and broke off, while a blush rose visibly from the crests
of foamy hair on her neck, up to her forehead.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ellen, why will you associate with that bad man?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Claude asked the question in a grave, steady voice, which
would have warned a wiser person not to trifle with the subject.
But Ellen possessed the coquetry and craft of a small
character—no real wisdom.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Bad man! Everybody that I know of calls him a gentleman,
except you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You can not be a judge where a person like this is
concerned. No refined woman could have the power to
understand him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But other people receive him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not, and with good reason.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Claude, you—yes, I see it—you are jealous.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The reckless girl clapped her hands like a child, and,
burying her head on Mrs. La Clide’s lap, broke into a forced
laugh.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, Ellen, I am not jealous. No honorable man could
be, here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then do be good, and let this poor man alone.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ellen, listen to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I listen, but do get it over with. I hate scolding.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“This has become a serious question between us—a question
which may end in a separation.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>The girl flushed crimson, and sat upright, with angry
gleams coming into her eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, sir, what is it you want of me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish you to give up any acquaintance which exists
between you and young Houston.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed!”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a sneer in her voice, but he did not notice it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I desire that you will never walk with or speak to him
again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And turn hermit or nun—which would please you best?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Neither would please me. You know how well I like
society, and I know how well you can adorn it. Let this be
happily and worthily, and I ask no more. Look around
these rooms. How often you have seen them filled with the
best and highest of the land. I wish nothing different in my
married life. But no disreputable man shall ever cross my
threshold or speak to my wife; of that be assured.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed, you begin early to play the censor over me and
my friends.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was something in her voice now that hardened her
lover.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The woman I marry must be so far above suspicion that
censorship can not reach her,” he answered, almost sternly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Suspicion, sir—suspicion!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do not mistake me. I charge you with nothing. On
the contrary, I believe it is your very innocence that leads
you into the appearance of evil.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Evil! evil!”</p>

<p class='c010'>She sprung to her feet, and confronted him, like a beautiful
fury. All her craft, all her cunning forsook her in that
storm of temper. In a single moment she was dashing the
work of her life into fragments. All this was so different
from the honeyed words she had just been listening to from the
lips of that bad man, that her true nature broke forth, but not
yet in words.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Still you misunderstand me,” said Claude, grieved and
astonished, “and to avoid this I must speak more plainly.
This Houston is not a proper associate for any woman, much
less for the one who is to share my home. You are young;
you are ignorant of the stories afloat about him, or you would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>not thus persist in wrecking both my happiness and your
own.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl had been growing pale with suppressed anger;
every fiber in her frame quivered, but still she had a smile
upon her lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pray, Claude, reserve these lectures till you have a right
to force them on me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That time will never come, Ellen.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Claude spoke in sorrow, but firmly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I am to understand you break our engagement?”</p>

<p class='c010'>She turned white to the lips; he, too, was pale and
cold.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Better that than see my name dishonored. Mother—mother,
do not leave us!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. La Clide seemed frightened. There was something
strangely wild in her eyes. This scene was becoming too
painful for her. She looked imploringly on her son.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I must go; the air of this room is close. Do not
be unkind, my son. Ellen, remember how we have loved
you!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The young girl turned upon her almost insolently. Her
lips curved into a sneer, but she restrained her speech, and
Mrs. La Clide left the room. Claude was softened by his
mother’s words. He followed her with loving glances from
the room, then turned more gently to his betrothed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ellen, dear Ellen, I do not wish to be unkind. You
know well how I have loved you. Your wish has always
been my law, but I can not surrender my self-respect.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nor can I.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ellen, I beg—beseech you to listen to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do listen, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The rapid beat of her foot on the carpet, the firm clinch
of her hands, the compressed lip and suppressed breath, told
in unmistakable language with what spirit she listened.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Give up the society of that man, for my sake, for my
noble mother’s sake—she, so honorable, so sensitive to all
the proprieties of life, it would kill her were a breath of shame
to fall on one of our household.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, sir, I will not forget your mother. She has been
in my thoughts very often since this engagement.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“Well!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, it is not well; of what more do you accuse me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I accuse you of nothing—only plead with you. Give up
this dangerous acquaintance.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Suppose I do not choose to gratify your jealous demand?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He stood in silence a moment, looking at her steadily, with
a glance in those velvety eyes that would have touched any
other woman to the soul.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you and I must part.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then be it so!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The rage in her heart broke forth, now she had lost all
control of herself.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ellen, think again, for my mother’s sake; she loves you
already as a daughter. Look, she is coming back.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“For her sake. What is she to Ellen Worthington—the
half-breed—the Indian?”</p>

<p class='c010'>She had advanced to the door, and stood with one hand
on the latch, revealed in all the bitterness of her true nature.
She turned, and stood face to face with the woman she had
insulted. The deathly white of that face struck her insolence
dumb. She shrunk away and crept from the house,
baffled and in fierce anger with herself.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. La Clide stood near the threshold, waving to and
fro, but without the power to move.</p>

<p class='c010'>Claude sprung forward.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mother, dear mother!”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the wail of a strong heart in agony—the plaintive
cry of a soul suddenly stricken in its love.</p>

<p class='c010'>She fell across the threshold, before his outstretched arms
could reach her. He lifted her up, and laid her head upon
his bosom, calling out:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mother! mother! mother!”</p>

<p class='c010'>  She made no answer; her eyes were closed, a tinge of blue
crept around her mouth. During all that scene, her heart had
been laboring with fearful struggles. When the last insulting
speech fell on her ear, piercing the hidden pain of her
life, the poor heart gave one wild leap, and carrying death
with it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Days of dark delirium to the bereaved man followed. His
body became a wreck and his mind a chaos. Wild shapes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>flitted through his brain, and fever parched up the springs of
life. With body and brain thus terribly wrung—thus strained
to an unnatural tension, the wonder was that he survived
the shock of that cruel loss. But life had many stern duties
for him—lessons to be learned—battles to be fought—deeds
of daring to be done.</p>

<p class='c010'>Breathing, but unconscious—dead to all around him, he
lingered for weeks on the parting ridge between time and
eternity; then came days of rest, of sweet, unthinking repose.
Mind and body both slept, and, refreshed, he awoke, weak,
very weak, but sane. A month of careful nursing followed,
and his mind became bright, though somewhat chastened in
its fiery impetuosity—his figure resumed its erect poise and
grace of motion—stern determination took the place of vacillating
purpose. He was once more a man! But that house
could no longer be his home. The serpent had left its trail
over every thing there. He must seek a new life.</p>

<p class='c010'>His course was soon adopted and his plans completed. He
left his estate to the care of a tried friend. But even then,
some lingering of the love he had sternly banished from his
soul flashed up again for an instant, and he secured a competency
to the woman, who, rock-like, had shipwrecked his
last hopes. From the elk-horns on which it had so long
rested, he took down the very rifle his grandfather had carried
when he went on the Indian trail—took the wampum
belts, and pouch, and tomahawk and knife—arrayed himself
in the same well-worn hunting-dress—flung upon his horse
the trappings of a <i><span lang="fr">gens du lac</span></i>, and turned his back upon
civilization, to seek in the wild prairie forgetfulness of self.
The home he sought was in the wigwams of the Dacotahs.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>
  <h2 id='CHAPTER_V' class='c003'>CHAPTER V.<br> <span class='c008'>THE PRISONER OF THE DACOTAHS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>On a gently-sloping bank, which fell greenly to one of the
many streams that empty into the north fork of the Platte,
the Dacotahs had erected their encampment. On the rich
sward, and in the shade of clustering trees, the wigwams had
been hastily erected, and the business of savage life commenced
its course. The fires of the morning were just
beginning to send up white puffs and blue curls of smoke,
that floated among the forest-branches in a thousand fanciful
wreaths, at which the painted warriors gazed dreamily as
they smoked in silent idleness around the encampment.
Half-clad children tumbled on the grass or rolled in and out
into the stream, rioting in the waves like water-dogs, and
shouting out their animal joy, till the whole prairie rung
with it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Outside the camp, snarling curs fought over the already
well-picked bones, or slunk off yelping, when punished for
their constant thefts. In the background, horses browsed
luxuriantly on the tender foliage of the trees which surrounded
the little prairie with a belt of arching greenness.</p>

<p class='c010'>Through the openings of these trees, hunters could be
seen in groups, returning from the woods laden with game.
The wigwams were built in a large circle, apart from a lodge
of superior dimensions that stood in the center, and yet, in a
way, guarding it. This lodge was gaudily decorated, and
the painted buffalo-skins which covered it were fastened
closely to the ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>Every thing about this lodge was silent as night; there was
no noise from within, no sign that it was inhabited Not a
curve of smoke came from its cone-like top. Not a child
played near it: so closely was it guarded, that a savage footstep
dared not venture within speaking distance of it. Yet
how still the lodge was—you would have thought it a habitation
of the dead.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Black Eagle came from his night rendezvous and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>entered the encampment, not with his usual savage pomp,
but quite alone, and stealthily, as if he would gladly have
escaped observation. It was not fear or modesty, but crafty
cunning which rendered him so cautious. The gold which
he had received weighed him down with anxiety. His
treachery in holding the secret negotiation he well knew
would, if once known, destroy his popularity with the tribe.
Besides this, it would enforce a division of the spoils.</p>

<p class='c010'>To place this gold in a safe hiding-place had been his first
object; compared to this, the safety of his prisoner had sunk
into a secondary consideration. More than once, in his rapid
march toward the Dacotah camping-ground, he had resolved
to bury his treasure in some rocky gorge, or hide it in the
crevices of some unfrequented cañon, or sink it deep in some
swift-running stream. But avarice, the master demon passion
of his nature, forbade this. So long as possible, he yearned
to detain the gold in his own personal keeping. Thus, he
brought it with him to the tribe, and crept like a thief stealthily
into the camp where he had a right to command.</p>

<p class='c010'>He entered his own wigwam, and after cautiously assuring
himself that no one was present to observe his action, thrust
aside the brand from the center fire with his foot, and buried
his treasure deep, deep in the ground underneath. He
stamped it down close, scattered the ashes deftly over the
spot, heaped the brands together again, then breathing
deeply, as if a load had been lifted from his heart, gathered
up his savage dignity, and stalked forth into the encampment.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Black Eagle paused to speak with no one, but strode
forward to that lone wigwam, and raising a corner of one of
the skins, entered it.</p>

<p class='c010'>An abrupt movement, and a wild sharp cry greeted him.
Like a fawn, which some deep mouthed hound has tracked to
its hiding-place, Esther sprung from a pile of furs, and
retreating to the furthest bounds of the wigwam, stood
regarding the savage, her eyes full of wild terror, her white
lips trembling, and every pulse in her body quivering with
horror and disgust.</p>

<p class='c010'>Black Eagle looked upon her in grim triumph.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The daughter of the pale-face has been smiled upon by
the Manitou of dreams. The waves of sweet slumber have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>been surging in her ears,” he said, toning down his deep,
guttural voice into something like gentleness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why am I kept here? Tell me, why have I been so
cruelly torn from my father?” she cried, passionately. “How
could you have the heart to return our kindness in this way?
Think of the Laramie. Did we not befriend you then better
than any of your own people?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pale-face, your words fall on the ear of Black Eagle
sweet as the song for birds in spring-time; his heart drinks
them in as the dry earth opens itself to the summer rain—speak
on.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are cruel, unprincipled; you evade my question. Tell
me, oh, I beg of you, tell me for what purpose I am here.
Why have I been made a prisoner? If gold is your object,
my father will give it you in handfuls for my safe return.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The yellow dust of the pale-faced chief will yet be stored
in the wigwams of the Dacotahs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What! Man, if you are a man, what terrible meaning is
hid beneath your words?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Dacotahs are masters of the prairie! When the moccasin
of his enemies leave their print upon the trail, the warriors
gather thick around like the buzzards. He has robbed
the red-man of his lands and hunting-grounds—has driven
the deer and buffalo away before the thunder of his fire-weapon.
They starve for food—he has plenty. They long
for the swift-footed horses—he has them by hundreds. Their
little ones cry for milk—his wigwams are filled with it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you would basely steal his daughter and afterward
plunder him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let the girl of the snowy skin listen. The words of the
warrior are few. Not his the tongue to prattle like the little
pappoose, or tell of his deeds like the squaw of an hundred
winters. The Eagle of the Dacotahs saw the young dove of
the valley. He swept from his mountain home on his broad
wings and there was mourning and blackened faces in the
parent nest.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But why have you done this, if gold was not your object?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When a soft glance of the fiery-eyed sun steals into the
wigwam of the pale-faces, does he shut it out? When the
smile of morning cleaves its way through the shadows of night,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>does he hang thick blankets in his way? The red-man is not
a fool. He has eyes and he can see.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why speak in riddles? Tell me plainly of your meaning,
if you would have me answer.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The daughter of the chief of the long rifles came to the
wigwams of the Black Eagle. He looked upon her and his
heart grew sick of the brown faces of his tribe. When he
returns from the long trail, with aching feet and tired limbs,
the white-faced maiden shall make his wigwam bright.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Still I can not comprehend. Your words are a mystery
and your actions shrouded,” answered Esther, turning deathly
pale.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Black Eagle would have a pale-face squaw to dress his
venison and fringe his leggins with the scalp-locks.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What! Your wife? Merciful heavens, you can not mean
that!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The tongue of the pale girl is sweet; her hair is like the
silk of the maize, when browned in the moon of the falling
leaf. She has turned the trail of truth. She shall find a
home in the wigwam of the red-man. The Black Eagle has
said it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never! I will die first.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The angel with wings like the thunder-cloud that stands
by the dark river comes not when the children of earth call.
Many years yet the moccasin of the wife of Black Eagle will
press the prairie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your wife—the White Hawk—yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Waupee will wait upon the new wife of Black Eagle.
She is put away from the breast of the warrior.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Any thing but your wife.” The poor girl shuddered as
she spoke the hateful word. “Merciful heaven, am I reserved
a fate like this?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The dove may beat its tender breast against its prison,
but the coo of its song will yet be music for the ears of its
mate when it looks for his coming with its wings folded.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I your mate! I dwell in your wigwam! Listen to me,
treacherous man. Sooner than submit to that, I would leap
from the precipice and dash myself into atoms on the jagged
rocks beneath—leap into the deep stream and float a disfigured
corpse among the reeds on its shore—with my own hand I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>will destroy the life God has given me, and escape with self-murder
from your loathsome power.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Without deigning to reply to what he perhaps scarcely
understood, the savage whistled long and shrill. In a moment
the poor, injured and abandoned wife, Waupee, entered,
shrinking and trembling as if in mortal terror. A few words
of command were given to her in her nation’s tongue that the
white girl could not understand, and without lifting her eyes,
Waupee departed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let the child of the white man prepare!” continued Black
Eagle. “The Medicine of the tribe is hastening to prepare the
marriage ceremony of the Dacotahs. The maidens are weaving
the bright flowers of spring, and the warriors decking
themselves in their best robes. The hour has come. The
wigwam of the sachem shall lift its mat for a new bride.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Man! man! is there no mercy in your heart, no feeling,
no pity?”</p>

<p class='c010'>A whistle—a signal, apparently—fell upon the ear of the
Indian. He seemed greatly disturbed, and without reply, hurried
from the wigwam. As he lifted the covering on one side
in passing, the form of the White Hawk entered at the other.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Waupee, White Hawk!” exclaimed Esther, clinging to
her. “Save me from this awful fate. Think of my father—think
of my friends—of those that love me, those that I love.
For the sake of heaven, if I was ever kind to you, save me
now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The finger of the poor, discarded wife was pressed upon
her lips, and bending low she kissed the hem of Esther’s dress
but did not speak a word. But her movements were rapid
as thought. From the folds of her garments she drew forth
a long and slender knife, placed it in the hands of the prisoner,
and almost before her purpose could be divined, glided
from the wigwam.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thanks, at least, for this,” muttered the prisoner under
her breath. “When all else fails, I will use your knife, poor
Waupee.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A step approached, and concealing the knife, she stood,
white and statue-like, awaiting the next phase of her destiny.
It was only a girl of the Dacotahs who brought food. In
her desperation, Esther strove to question her; but the girl
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>stood motionless while she spoke, with her eyes bent on the
ground, but gave no word of reply.</p>

<p class='c010'>She placed the rude meal, upon still ruder dishes of birch
bark, on a mat in the center of the wigwam, and went out, having
performed her task in profound silence. Filled with
terrible apprehensions, Esther did not touch the food, but,
drawing the knife from her bosom, stood at bay, ready to use
it in self-defense, or, failing that, in self-sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why should I not use it now—before he comes?” she
murmured. “It is but a blow, and I am safe. But oh, the
dark labyrinth of that unknown valley; my very soul shudders
at the thought of threading it unbidden. Better endure the
black horrors of my situation a little longer, trusting in a
merciful God, than escape by crime.” A touch upon the
arm brought her with a wild leap from the ground where
she had been sitting. It was Waupee, the wife of Black
Eagle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The daughter of the pale-face can cease weeping. Black
Eagle is listening for the hoofs of his enemies. He sees a
great cloud of dust on the prairie, and he has many foes. Eat
in peace; he will take the trail and ride toward the setting
sun.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Esther’s strength gave way now. She fell upon her knees,
and sobbed out her passionate gratitude, clinging to the poor
Indian wife and lavishing kisses on her robe and her
hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>An hour later, and, seated upon a but half-tamed steed, with
a painted warrior at either side, she was hurried forward
toward the rocky cañon known as the South Pass.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 id='CHAPTER_VI' class='c003'>CHAPTER VI.<br> <span class='c008'>WATER!</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>With the long mane of his swift and sure-footed steed
streaming in the wind, his tall form seeming a part of the
horse he bestrode, Waltermyer led the way, followed by the
anxious father and his men. There was no drawing of rein
or slacking of speed—no breathing of horses or resting of
men. It was to be with them a race for life, and every minute
was dear and important as weeks of common time. But
what course should they take? This was now the question,
and Miles Morse, as he spurred his horse forward in the almost
vain task of equaling the pace of Waltermyer, felt that
all was uncertainty. But not so the border man. Blind trails
were to him pleasant explorations. He was ever on the
watch, his wits sharpened by constant exercise and constant
danger. The wild excitement of a chase like that was far
more to his liking than the winding horn and the baying of
hounds ever was to hunter. Mot a single thought had he of
failure. True he might be too late to save the girl from the
clutches of her enemies, but not too late to make them pay
the penalty of their dastard deed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stranger,” he said, suddenly reining in his horse upon the
summit of a knoll that enabled him to overlook the country
for miles, “Stranger, did you say the gal was pooty?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“More than that—most people call her beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And the Mormon—Thomas—has seen her?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; I remember that was his name.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To be sure it was. Kirk Waltermyer ain’t a fool, by a
long shot. When he sees a doe wandering alone on the
perarer, he knows from what thicket the cayotes will start
in pursuit.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But we waste time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Better take breath now than have our horses without
wind when the time comes for them to go. And she was a
pooty gal, was she?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The question was not unnatural to a man like Waltermyer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>whose life had been spent in those trackless prairies and in
the rocky cañons of the mountains. Since his childhood he
had scarcely even seen a beautiful woman, or met with the
refinement which no man appreciates more keenly than the
border scout.</p>

<p class='c010'>No one was more familiar with the squaws and dancing-girls
of Toas, or the pale wrecks of civilization sometimes
found in the squatters’ cabins on the Columbia; but feminine
refinement had been to him a vague memory that soon
became his dream. His idea of a beautiful and educated
woman would have matched the inspiration with which more
perfect imaginations regard the angels of heaven. He could
not think of a woman so endowed without a bowing down
of his iron will, in imagination, at her feet. He was bashful
and timid as a little child when these fancies crossed his
path. He would have considered Sampson a happy and
honored man in being permitted to lay down his strength at
the feet of a beautiful woman. The border man looked upon
women of this class as flowers that a rude hand like his
would crush even in kindness—formed of far different and
more celestial material than that which composed his strong
arm and symmetrical limbs.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is a truth that your daring Western frontiersman makes a
refined woman his idol—a creature to work for, fight for, and
die for, if need be, without a murmur. A smile from the
beloved lips is ample payment for days and nights of toil, and
a word of praise is reward enough for any danger that life
can bring to him. Living, as he does, amid all that is poetic
and sublime in nature, his associations render him peculiarly
alive to the visions that take force and form from the solitude
of thought to which he is often left, weeks and months together.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus the man who would not shrink from a hand to front
encounter with the giant bear of the rocky sierras is ready
to worship the being who has realized his fancy—to guard,
defend and reverence her as less powerful natures never
could.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pooty, is she?” repeated Waltermyer, after a pause.
“Waal, she’s no bird, then, to find a cage among the animiles
at Salt Lake. I’d have give fifty slugs or an hundred head
to have been upon the trail sooner. ’Tain’t every horse can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>keep up with mine, stranger; but if it was, we’d be rattlin’
onto the rocks of Devil’s Gate before the sun rose again. No,
no; ’tain’t of no use. I don’t know of but one kedripid this
side of the big river that can keep the lope with him for a
hull day. A master horse this, stranger. More’n once he has
saved my life, when the red devils were buzzin’ thick as bees
onto my trail and sharpenin’ their knives to take my har.
But Kirk Waltermyer had but to speak, and they thought a
streak of black lightnin’ was rolling over the perarer. I’ve
owned many a horse in my life, but this one is—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“See; there is dust rising yonder,” interrupted the impatient
father.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I see!” and he sprung erect upon his steed to get a
better view.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is it? Are the Indians coming?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“As sure as you are here. But they ain’t coming this
way. Is your guard strong enough to keep your train?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Against an ordinary force. But why do you ask?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because if they hain’t there will not be a single hoof left.
The red devils know you’ll try to find the gal, and so they
think they’ll kinder pitch into the ring and help themselves.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is to be done?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Done!</span>” almost thundered the frontiersman in reply, as he
again resumed his place in the saddle. “Done? You can
go back and take care of the train if you like, but Kirk
Waltermyer never leaves the trail of that gal.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Neither shall I.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let the men go back! If your hand is only firm, and
your eye true, it is all I ask; if not, you turn back too, and
I’ll take the risk alone.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That would not be safe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Safe! I have never seen an hour of safety since I cut
loose from the settlements and took to a roving life. Stranger,
I am a rude man, but I know, though I never had much book
learnin’, that I carry my life in my hand. But there is a
Power above that minds the poor, lone wanderer as well as
the dweller in cities.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; God never is forgetful of his children.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But, stranger, we must not stand to talk here. Yender
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>goes a thievin’, throat-cuttin’ gang of red-skins. They mean
to have your stock; but if your boys are only steady and
fight half as well as La Moine, they will go back howlin’
without ary a hoof.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let us proceed, then. Cattle, property of any kind, is not
to be thrown into the scale against my daughter.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All the herds on the perarer are not worth a single curl of
her har. Do you see that timber yender?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; but it appears far distant.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Forty miles in a bee-line; but if we don’t get thar before
the moon rises, we might as well turn our horses loose and
give the gal up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let us push on, then. The day is a long one—our
horses are not fresh, and the day is drawing nigh to noon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thar you’re right. The sun comes straight down without
castin’ a shadder. If your horses had been only perarer-born
now, and could travel all day without water, then—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Travel all day without water!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“<em>Thar is not one drop between us and that timber!</em>”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Few then will reach it; but—hark!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The boys are at it! I’d give a sack full of slugs to be
thar! Aha! how the rifles speak! There goes a red devil
at every flash if they’d only Western hands hold of the stocks.
By the eternal! but they’ve stampeded the cattle! No; it’s
the prowlin’ reptiles runnin’ away like a pack of whipped
cayotes. Yes, there they go scamperin’ over the perarer.
Your train is safe, stranger, though thar may be more’n one
hand less to tend it; but heaven have mercy on the next that
comes along weak-handed. It’ll take many a hoof and many
a scalp to pay for this day’s work; and if they have seen La
Moine, it will be dangerous travelin’ for Kirk Waltermyer
after this.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You—why?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Only that I will have to father the hull of the business,
for they know the Frenchman and I always hunt in couples.
But no matter; the bullet ain’t run yet that will put a stop to
my breath. Now, stranger, since your yaller-boys and stock
is safe, we must put the long miles behind us if we’d save
the gal.”</p>

<p class='c010'>With the words still ringing upon the air, he dashed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>forward on his errand of mercy—perchance of doom! Forward
as a protecting Providence, and it might be as an
avenging Fate! Forward, as a lover seeking his mistress,
and yet the trail might end in blood!</p>

<p class='c010'>The checked and restrained pace of the city steed was but
as a snail’s progress to the whirlwind of their speed. Proudly
their crests were tossed aloft and their heads stretched out as
they flung their sinewy limbs in the long gallop that appeared
to laugh at space and scorn time. Joyous was the music of
ringing snaffle and spur, sweet the lyric of their clattering
feet to a horseman’s ear, and wild, almost, as if “desert-born”
their career, as they dashed on, snorting the hot breath from
their scarlet nostrils and flinging the foam from the champing
mouth. It was a race such as pelted thorough-breds may
never know of, and the pampered, stall-fed beast would fail
in, before a half-score miles were accomplished. Deeply the
gopher and the prairie-dog had mined the earth beneath—the
wolfs hole was yawning under their feet, and the long grass,
trailed and curled, tangling around them; but determination
had grasped the rein and a heart of fire led the van.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Halt!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The quick and ever-watchful eye of Waltermyer saw that
the horses of his followers were unequal to the task, and,
checking his own, he allowed them to move more slowly up
a slight rise—a green billow as it were, in that emerald sea,
crested with flowers, and looking more like the rolling swell
of mid-ocean, when the night-tempest has passed and the
morning sun has touched the topmost wave with light and
fretted it with fleecy gold.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We can never stand this pace—it will be death to the
horses, if not the men,” exclaimed Miles Morse, as he gazed
at the heaving flanks and sobbing nostrils—the sinking fire of
the eye and the trembling limbs. “The horses can not endure
it, and unless we proceed more slowly we shall soon be compelled
to go on foot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s a pity, stranger, to be mean to dumb beasts. I always
go agin it; but when there is life, human life, and that,
too, a woman’s, dependin’ on’t, it ain’t no use to talk about
horseflesh. It’s twenty good miles to the timber yet, and if
we don’t manage to reach it, every hoof will die of thirst.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>“And yet our only chance of life is in riding more slowly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And her’s in bein’ swift and persevering as the black
wolf of the mountains, that can outrun the buffalo and tire
the antelope.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But one thought had possession of Waltermyer. His
vivid though unrefined fancy had exalted Esther Morse into
a paragon, and, like Juliet, he wished but to annihilate space
and time, until he rescued her from danger. In action—fierce,
rapid and daring action, such souls alone find rest; and once
enlisted, nothing can swerve them from what becomes, in
their generous imagination, a sacred duty.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Waal, waal,” he continued, after a pause, “let the beasts
jog on for a while. You can’t expect horses that never saw
a perarer before to keep the speed. But if I had only a
know’d a month ago that we should’er had such a race
to run, I’d’er had horses from a corral I know of, that
would not have broke a gallop till they run their noses into
them trees. It’s only fun for my horse, but it’s death to
your’n.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Slowly, for an hour, they proceeded, with the hardy pioneer
chafing every moment at the delay, and his equally hardy
steed pressing against the bit, as if wondering at this unusual
restraint.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Waal, waal,” he said, addressing his horse from time to
time, as if he had been his sole companion, “Waal, waal,
Blazin’ Star, (he named him so, from the single white mark
he had about him—the snowy spot in his forehead,) I didn’t
think we’d be joggin’ across the perarer to-day as if we was
goin’ to a funeral. Any horse that is not good for an all
day’s run isn’t of any account here, and the sooner the
buzzards foreclose the mortgage they have on them, the
better.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Insensibly, unknown to himself, he had slackened the rein,
and his impatient horse had stretched his lithe limbs again
into a gallop. With the careless fling that tireless power
ever gives, and the certainty of foot that only comes with
constant practice, he sped along, making light of the task,
and leaving the rest far behind. Keen-eyed, and with heart
of fire and limbs that mocked at exertion, he would have
sped on, on, until the shafts of death struck him in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>reckless career, had not the iron curb again forced his will
to bend to the strong hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>And a sad scene for one so tender of heart awaited his
eyes. The truly brave are ever merciful, and as the gallant
soldier is both just and kind to his conquered enemy, so is
the master to the dumb beast that becomes at once friend and
companion on the lengthy trail. The pain of his steed
becomes his own, and, tenderly and kindly as a mother, he
watches, and strains every nerve to alleviate his sufferings.</p>

<p class='c010'>The horses came struggling through the rank herbage up
the long swell, reeling, staggering, and to hold their
own in the desperate toil. On they came, flecked with foam,
their great eyes dim with exhaustion, their flanks heaving,
their inflamed nostrils widely distended as the hot, dry breath
panted through them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Poor wretches, it was a pain to look upon them, so patient
and so ready to drop down dead in that horrible journey.
Their poor lips were drawn back, for the relaxed muscles
no longer held them firmly in place, and the dry tongue fell
helplessly through the yellow teeth, now visible to the roots.
As the poor, dumb creatures turned their glaring eyes on
their masters, but one wild pitying cry went up from the
human lips:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Water! water!”</p>

<p class='c010'>That speechless agony of insupportable thirst—the horrible
tragedy of mindless creatures perishing in dumb submission,
made those stern men forget their own anguish. That picture
of men and beasts grouped together in one horrible suffering
was awful to behold.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Waltermyer,” whispered the despairing father, in a voice
that came hoarse and faint from the parched lips and seared
throat, “can we not find water?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you no flask, man?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is emptied long ago.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Take mine, then.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good! But the horses? Can we not dig a well here?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dig! Why, man, you would go to China before you
found enough to wet the tongue of a bird. Do these sage
bushes look as if they had ever seen dew?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then the horses must die.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>“Not yet. Strip them of your heavy saddles—throw the
blankets away. The cool air will revive them, and so we
gain miles. Then, if worst comes to worst, they must be
left, and my word for it, they will find water themselves long
before morning. A beast’s instincts never fail in that
matter. I’ve seen it tried over and again. Off with your
saddles, boys, and drive the horses before you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He was obeyed, and again the company started, and straggled
on. But the toil soon told on the men. They mounted
once more, and forced the beasts forward, staggering, stumbling,
falling.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Water!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The cry came now most piercing from parched human
lips, for the sun, blazing above their heads, poured down
sheeted fire upon them, and the now almost herbless earth
was like an oven beneath their feet. Dense as the smoke
from the smouldering ruins of a burning city, the dust rose,
but to settle again, choking and blinding them. The breeze
of morning was dead, and millions of myriads of insects
swept a dense cloud along their path. It was agony to struggle
on—death to remain!</p>

<p class='c010'>“Water!”</p>

<p class='c010'>With cracking lips and bloodshot eyes, they staggered on.
The horses were fast becoming mad with thirst, and covered
with blood from the pitiless stings of hungry insects—with
the fiery sky and baked earth beneath, they still stumbled
forward, hopeless, fainting, gasping for life.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Water!”</p>

<p class='c010'>In the yet distant timber, the green leaves rustled and sung
a dewy psalm—the liquid crystals dropped into mossy pools—flashed
over the white pebbles—leaped from the lofty rock—danced
in foamy eddies, and flung high the wreaths of
misty spray. Cool and sparkling they slept in the deep
pools, sung along the rapids, and showered the jutting rocks,
until they looked like Tritons shaking their wet locks, and
rising from an ocean’s bed. From the far-off springs, the icegrottoes
and eternal snows of their mountain home, they had
come, laughing, leaping, dashing, to charm the mind with
fairy pictures, and gratify the thirsty soul, until it reeled with
the overflowing of perfect satiety. Ah! what a dream for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>fevered lips—bodies aflame with heat, and hearts sinking
with the long-endured sufferings of ungratified thirst. What
a vivid mockery it was.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Water! water!” whispered every tongue, and the hollow-eyed
and gasping horses told of still deeper want.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Water, for God’s sake, Waltermyer, guide us to water,”
was now the continued cry.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Be men! A short hour will bring us to it. See yender,
where the ground looks dead, and dry, and parched. That
is the long grass of a savanna; beyond it we can find water
by digging. The <i><span lang="es">arroyas</span></i> may not be dried up, but if they
are, thar is, or was an old well thar that never failed me yet.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come on, then!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Oh! with what fearful hoarseness the sound came from
the seared throats—a harsh, file-like, rasping sound, as if the
breath was forced between the thickly-set saw-teeth, or could
find an outlet only between ragged stones.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That I will, boys. I’d even go before—for, see, my horse
hasn’t turned a hair yet—and bring you water, if I dared.
Put a bullet in your mouths, and we’ll drink toasts yet, around
the Challybate spring.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A horse dropped now and then, but they could not pause
for that. Mind was superior in the struggle to matter. A
man fell but was lifted up, encouraged, and again toiled on.
The savanna was reached—the tall, dry, flag-like grass rose
above them on every side, and walled them in alike from air
and sun, but, alas! so also it confined the dust, and robbed
them of the scanty breathing they had before enjoyed. But
on! on! wildly they crept.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A mile more and we are safe. Courage, boys!” shouted
Waltermyer, standing up, as was his wont when he wished
to reconnoiter, upon the back of his steed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The rods appeared to lengthen out into furlongs, and the
furlongs into miles; but, cheering each other, they still continued,
almost groping their way. Hark! The heads of the
remaining horses were lifted at the strange sound—their ears
were erected—their eyes flashed wildly, and with a loud neigh
they dashed over those who stood in their path, and, as if
fiend-driven, rushed to the stream, and almost buried themselves
in the tide.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>An hour later, swarthy forms were stretched upon the
grassy banks, and gratified senses were satisfied with the
dewy mists rising around, and the cool, mountain-fed waters
that sparkled at their feet.</p>

<p class='c010'>Waltermyer had redeemed his promise, and the tide flowed
by as uncared-for as if it had not been to them Heaven’s gift
itself only a few hours before.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='CHAPTER_VII' class='c003'>CHAPTER VII.<br> <span class='c008'>THE MORMON’S RIDE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Morning came, and the tents of the Mormons were struck—the
jaded teams harnessed and the march began. So long
had they been upon the trail that there was no confusion. All
had been reduced to system—each man knew his place, and
few were the orders required. All, save their leader, were
looking forward to the “promised land,”—the valley that was
to flow with milk and honey—the city of refuge—the abode
of the saints. Truly with these people ignorance was bliss.
They were happy in this delusion—satisfied with anticipation.
But the man that rode that day alone—the man whose serpent
tongue had lured the ignorant to leave home and kindred by
the most infamous falsehoods—who knew well that the living
springs he had pictured would become as the Red Sea, and the
golden fruits as bitter ashes to their lips, thought neither of city
or valley—temple or font. His mind was wandering amid a
rocky cañon, and he was planning a rescue that should give
to him the prestige of a benefactor. Yet even he felt the truth
of the words, “the wicked flee when no man pursueth.” Might
not his steps have been followed, and the conversation with
the Indian overheard? With the suspicion of guilt he narrowly
examined the faces of those who had been on guard the previous
night, and endeavored by wily questions to learn the
very thing he dreaded most to know.</p>

<p class='c010'>Slowly the patient cattle toiled over the dry prairie, for on
leaving the well-watered camping-ground the scene around
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>them changed as if the angel of destruction had passed before
them, leaving blight and desolation. The green grass had
been replaced by withered sage—the mossy bank by sun-cracked
earth, and the cool, dewy air by the breath of a
furnace. But still they toiled on, for was not the golden
dream-land beyond? On, on, over the fenceless prairie—up
the long slopes—along the road beaten by thousands upon
thousands of feet until hard as iron, they wandered, a lost
people seeking for rest they would never know.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was near noon, hot and sultry, and the fainting teams
were unyoked. In the scanty shade of the wagons the men
threw themselves down, while the poor women cooked, toiled
and fretted over the fire. “Elder” Thomas relaxed his dignity
and seated himself amid a group of the youngest and
fairest, and strove to ingratiate himself with the still hopeful
maidens. Apparently at his ease, and with a mind untroubled
by care, he was in reality as if clad in the shirt of Nessus,
for it was nearing the hour of his appointment with the
Indian and his base heart was trembling over the result of his
plan.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some plausible excuse was necessary in order to free himself
from his companions—not all, though, for cowardice would
not allow him to face Black Eagle and his savage warriors
alone. They knew that he possessed gold—for he had been
forced to give up a portion of his hoarded store to gratify the
avarice of the Indian, and well he knew that their cupidity
was not easily satisfied, or their longing for plunder ever put
to rest.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The cañons are lurkin’ places for the rascally Utes,” he
said, to one of the foremost of the train who came to learn
his commands with regard to the march. “It would not do to
lead the Lord’s people into an ambush where they would be
slaughtered like sheep in a pen.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They have not dared to attack us thus far,” was the
response.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know they are afeard of us on the open ground,” said
the elder, “but when they hide in the rocks and shoot their
poisoned arrows down from their secret dens, bravery is of
little use.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We should send scouts ahead, then.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>“Yes, that’s just what I’m going to do. I’ll take about a
dozen of the young men and see that the coast is clear.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Even I! Am I not a leader in Israel?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But think of your precious life!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Verily he was thinking of it, and how precious it was, at
least to himself; but in a far different sense than his follower
supposed. There was a rare prize to be won, or he would
never have ventured his precious person in the undertaking.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church,” he
replied, having somewhere picked up the expression and deeming
it particularly <em>apropos</em> to the present occasion—high-sounding,
and likely to “tell” upon the hearers.</p>

<p class='c010'>So it was settled; accompanied by half a score of picked
men, he set out, after having designated the point where the
train should rest for the night—a place having the indispensable
accessories of feed and water. A short gallop brought
the elder and his men within view of a rocky gorge of the
hills, that appeared as if cleft by some wizard spell from topmost
crest to base; or as if a giant thunder-bolt had been
hurled from on high and torn its way through the living rocks;
or a riving plowshare of huge proportions had left a mighty
furrow, never to be planted by the hand of presumptuous
man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, boys,” the leader said, dropping his voice to the
lowest octave within its range, “we’ll soon be there. I’ve
often traveled it before and will lead the way. Keep close
together and mind you keep your eyes about you, though I
don’t think we shall have any trouble. Hark!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The hoarse croaking and a great flapping of wings bespoke
the passage of a buzzard in search of its loathsome prey—of
some poor beast which had been left to feed these scavengers
of the wilderness and their fierce copartners, the ravenous
wolves. How he scorned them, as, ghoul-like, they passed,
stretching their thin necks and casting dark shadows on the
path. Yet, was not his own errand far less merciful? Were
not these wolves his peers?</p>

<p class='c010'>An eagle rose and soared on its strong wings higher and
higher until it became a speck in the ether. A matchless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>bird was that eagle; his nest was built on the topmost cliff of
a cloud-piercing mountain—from the giant pine that stood on
its crest he could look down on the whirling storms and listen
to the thunder rolling and crashing below. His eye shrunk
not, blinded, from the noonday sun, like meaner birds, but
looked on when its red disk seemed steeped in blood, nor
closed when the forked lightning shot its flame-tipped shafts
hurtling through the murky gloom. A matchless bird—freedom’s
grand type, the chosen bird of Jove, the tameless and
fetterless. Ah! brave wanderer, mount ever where foot of
man can never stray. Tracker of the pathless azure, where his
thoughts alone may wander—dweller in the boundless fields
of the upper air and monarch of a mighty realm—realization,
almost, of the spirit’s dreamings, shall not the day come when
we too can roam at will, tracking the infinite, defiant of space,
regardless of time, cosmopolites of the entire Universe?</p>

<p class='c010'>Hark! A crash like a million of ringing anvils! Leaping,
bounding, thundering down the scarred side of the mountain,
rolls a huge rock, torn from its bed by some unknown power
and sent crashing into the yawning gulf below. The slumbering
echoes thunder back the sound, and nature quakes under
the fearful rush of the avalanche.</p>

<p class='c010'>The rocky bed of a dry stream was reached, and cautiously
the men proceeded, with their horses almost feeling the way
amid the loose stones. It was a moment of fear with them
all, for the giant bowlder must have been forced from its bed by
some fearful human power. What it might portend none
could tell, but caution in that locality became a necessity.
Every eye was turned upward, expecting that this avalanche
would be followed by others more imposing and more fatal.
Every moment they expected to hear the thundering of
another mass and see a mammoth rock come leaping from the
lofty crest, whelming them in <em>debris</em> and death.</p>

<p class='c010'>But they still proceeded in safety. Still the tired horses
daintily picked their way and the riders watched the frowning
cliffs. At length the leader turned, and led them through
the thick underbrush by a winding path that each moment
became more difficult of ascent. Even his power and iron
will, so long paramount to every scruple, was fast yielding to
the terrors of the place. They looked upon the march as one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>of certain death, if a foe should be lurking above—the undertaking
foolhardy in the extreme, and they but victims to a
causeless whim. In silence the Mormon heard their complaints
for a time, then commanded a halt.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Remain here,” he said. “Perhaps you’re right, and I
stand a better chance of finding out what is above if I go
alone. You stay here, boys, and keep quiet; but if you hear a
shot fired, leave your horses and come to my help.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The men took him at his word, and he started on foot,
having given up his rifle, and armed only with well-concealed
pistols. His plans had been thwarted by the reluctance of
his companions. But his path was not a long one. From a
lookout rock he saw a dark train of savage warriors winding
through the valley, scarcely a mile ahead. Dashing down
the hillside, he again joined his companions.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s Indians!” he shouted—“rascally Utes, and, by the
beard of the Prophet, they are carrying off a white girl! Now,
boys, be steady and brave, and we will not only punish them,
but free their prisoner. Come on, men, but do not fire—it
will only exasperate them. Ride them down, and make a
show of your arms, but don’t shoot, I say; you might kill
the girl.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The dreams of many a dark hour were near their fulfillment,
as he fondly thought. He had but to stretch out his
hand to grasp success. Mounting again, he led the way back
to the bed of the dry stream, and the men followed, urging
their horses forward with all possible speed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There they are, riding like so many devils,” he whispered,
to the nearest; then, recollecting his office as spiritual guide
and instructor, continued: “that is, speaking after the manner
of men. See! they turn the point—now are out of sight.
By heaven—may I be forgiven for the word—they are aiming
for the hills! Once there, and no white man can follow
them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But why should we follow?” asked the one nearest to
him. “The girl does not belong to us, and we only risk our
lives for one of the ungodly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“By precept and example, by persuasion, and, if need be,
by the sword, we are instructed to pluck the lost like brands
from the burning. Let him who fears return. I will go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>forward, for is it not written on the golden plates found by
the martyr, Joseph Smith, that he who falls in <em>the cause</em> shall
gain a crown of priceless glory?”</p>

<p class='c010'>An unearthly yell rung through the valley ahead of them,
as if fiends kept holiday, and sent their howling song mocking
the echoes—a very chaos of strangled joy. But words are
feeble and language faint to describe the horrors of an Indian
war-whoop when first it bursts upon unaccustomed ears.
Earth has nothing horrible or thrilling that can be compared
to its shrill, quivering notes. It is more like the laugh of
demons rejoicing over a lost soul than aught that human lips
could, by any possibility, compass. Echoing amid the fastnesses
of a mountain-gorge—telling of the brawny and pitiless
savage thirsting for blood and seeking for scalps—of the
blackened torture-post and the lingering agony by fire, it
becomes the very knell of all that is horrible and soul-affrighting.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indians! Indians!” whispered the men, with blanched
lips, as they crowded together like threatened sheep, striving
to gain courage from proximity.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” replied Elder Thomas, “it’s the way with the
reptiles. They always yell like so many panthers. But it
ain’t the bark we have to fear, boys, but the bite.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Had we not better go back and get help?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you knew the ways of the critters you wouldn’t talk
so. If they had intended any harm they wouldn’t have let us
know where they were. No, no. All we have to do is to go
ahead. Hold your horses hard, boys, and let them feel the
spur. It requires a steady hand and sure foot to—”</p>

<p class='c010'>The rest of the sentence was lost in air, for the horse that
had so long borne him safely, springing from the sharp rowel,
missed his footing, and both man and steed fell heavily
rolling over and over down the ragged hillside.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>
  <h2 id='CHAPTER_VIII' class='c003'>CHAPTER VIII.<br> <span class='c008'>PRAIRIE FIRE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Not long, although the scene around them was verdant
and peculiarly enticing after their severe struggle for life, did
Waltermyer allow his men to rest, for he knew well that the
enemy he was following would make no pause, and their
steeds, prairie-born and trained, wild and hardy as those they
carried, would make light of what to them had been a sore
trial. He knew, also, that night would put an almost effectual
barrier to their progress. As soon, therefore, as he thought
the horses sufficiently refreshed for travel, he gave the requisite
order, and, seconded by the poor, anxious father, found but
little difficulty in forcing obedience.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Up, men!” he shouted. “Ef your horses hain’t rested by
this time, ’tain’t no use tryin’ to go on.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Which way are we to proceed, Waltermyer? No more
prairie-work, I trust.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; we’ve done with that kinder thing, but we shall
have to cross the sloo again, before we can strike the trail.
It ain’t very wide. Then we’ll skirt along it, until we strike
the p’int thar whar the nose of the mounting runs inter the
perarer.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can we not keep on this side?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Onpossible; thar isn’t footin’ for a crawlin’ snake, and I
reckon them things can go almost onyw’ares. Ef you’ve a
mind to try it you can, but Kirk Waltermyer hasn’t parted
company with his senses yet, by a long shot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course we trust entirely to your guidance. Lead on
and we will follow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ef you only could foller as I could lead, we’d soon overhaul
the red rascals. But it ain’t no use in tryin’ to make
such brutes as yours keep up with a horse! Stranger, I told
you before there wasn’t but one on the perarer that could, and
he is—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What sound is that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Only some stun rollin’ down the mounting. I’ve often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>done the thing myself, just to see it jump and hear what an
infernal noise it would make.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“May it not be Indians?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indians? Now just you look a-here, stranger; if you
consate that any red-skin ever cut up such a white man’s
caper as that, you don’t know any more about them than I
do about Scriptur’, and that is mighty little. But this isn’t
followin’ the trail and savin’ the gal. Inter your saddles—no,
thank fortune you haven’t got any, and your beasts would
never stand them ef you had. But mount, onyway, and mind
you don’t go stragglin’ through the sloo, for though thar isn’t
any water thar now, there are quicksand beds, and ef you
git inter one you’ll go way down—down—down into
China.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Jaded as they had been by their previous journey, the
sparkling waters of the chalybeate spring, that foamed clear as
crystal and aeriform  as champagne, and the soft, juicy grasses
that margined them, had revived the horses, and again they
sprung forward, as if endowed with new life. Restraining
and petting his noble black, Waltermyer took the lead, and
soon they were lost to all surrounding objects in the tall dry
rushes that ever mark the course of what the Western borderers
call “sloo.” Fully two miles wide, the task of crossing
was not only seriously uncomfortable, on account of the heat
and the clouds of insects that arose before and around them,
but the footing was insecure, mined with holes and tangled
with treacherous roots.</p>

<p class='c010'>They rode on in silence, save when, now and then, some
serpent, gliding suddenly from under the feet of the horses,
startled them, and they leaped madly aloft with a wild snort,
their riders wondering at the movement, for their eyes had
not fallen on the reptile, with its gorgeous skin and fire-like
eyes, as it glided rustling along to seek some deeper hole in
which to coil its shiny folds.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Many a time,” exclaimed Waltermyer, with an almost
noiseless laugh, as one of the company was dismounted by
the leaping of the animal he rode, “I’d been willin’ to have
been thrown higher nor Independence Rock, to have just
caught sight of one of the critters.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of what? What was it? I didn’t see any thing.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>“No, nor know any thing until you found yourself flat.
Why, man, it was a rattlesnake, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A rattlesnake!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To be sure it was; and I suppose you didn’t know either
that the reptiles and perarer dogs and owls all lived in one
hole—sorter family parties.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pshaw!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Waal, you may pshaw, for you don’t know any better;
but when you have hunted for them to eat as long as I have,
you’ll be up to the dodge.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eat snakes!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, and mighty good eatin’ they are, though I don’t
hanker after them when thar’s any thing else round.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’d starve first.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wait till you try, boy. I tell you, a starvin’ man ain’t no
way perticular about what he eats. It’s a sorter first come
first served game. Now a mule isn’t the best kinder meat,
but it’s palytable then. Horse is juicy, ef he hasn’t been
worked to death, and rattlesnake is prime.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A hearty laugh followed the epicurean opinion of the hardy
frontiersman, and the march was resumed, with many an eye
turned to the ground to watch for the unwelcome visitors that
are a terror alike to man and beast, when Waltermyer continued:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just hold your horses, boys, for a minute. A little rest
won’t hurt them none, and mayhap they’ll need all the vim
they’ve got in them when it comes to the mountings. It’s
about four years ago since La Moine and I was crossin’ this
very sloo. It was a dreadful hot day—August—when the
snakes are blind as bats and ten times as venermous as in any
other month. You knew that, didn’t you? If one bites you
then it’s sartin death. Waal, as I was a-sayin’, the Frenchman
and I was a-ridin’ along—it was before I got this horse—when,
all of a sudden, I heard him give two of the orfulest
yells that ever was. It wasn’t any time to ask questions, so
I kinder looked, and, as I hope for mercy, ef thar’ wasn’t two
of the biggest kind of rattlers twisted around his horse, and
bitin’ away with all thar might at his throat. Somehow, I
never could understand the right of it. The horse must have
trod on their tails. Onyway, they didn’t live long, and the
poor horse died the orfulest to behold.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>“I thought you could cure the bite,” remarked Morse.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Waal, yes, so we can, ef we are only whar the blue-ash
grows or the snake-fern is to be found. But I can tell you,
stranger, that ef a man’s time has come ’tain’t no manner of
use to doctor him. It is only wastin’ whisky and time.
Remember that, boys, and—”</p>

<p class='c010'>The same war-whoop that had so startled the companions
of the Mormon fell upon their ears, but so faintly that few,
even if they had ever heard one before, could determine what
it was.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thar they go, way up in the mountings, the yellin’
painters.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What, the Indians that stole—”</p>

<p class='c010'>The heart-broken father could not finish the sentence. His
feelings rose beyond his control, and when they burst through
the fetters manhood attempted to impose upon them, they ran
riot and ended in tears.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think it is them, stranger, or else they have got
inter a fight. They wouldn’t be howlin’, and yelpin’, and
tearin’ round in that style, ef they was tryin’ to escape. No,
no; they are cunnin’ brutes, and know how to keep their
tongue between their teeth better than white folks. Anyhow,
we shan’t catch sight of them by stayin’ here talkin’ snake,
and get afeard of seein’ the crawlin’ reptiles.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let us press forward, then, and lose no more time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Waal, we ain’t a losin’ time. Haven’t you found out,
stranger, that a day’s restin’ when on a journey sometimes
was a day gained?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly, and have never traveled on the Sabbath.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sunday or week day, the same thing is a fact; but them
that know, say that rest is sweeter on that day. It may be,
stranger, and I ain’t book-learned enough to deny it, ’specially
as I hain’t known Sunday come more’n twice in the last ten
years, and that was when I was among the <em>Bois Brulé</em> gals,
way up on the Red river. Somehow, they keep count with
beads and little crosses, and I used to go to church with them,
and throw the worth of a beaver-skin onter the plate, so that
they wouldn’t refuse me when I wanted them to dance.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A smile flitted over the faces of his band at the peculiar
reason given by the guide for his piety. Perchance many of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>his more civilized neighbors could have offered no better one.
Once more he dashed to the front and led the way. But
very careful, indeed, were his movements, often standing
erect upon his horse, and looking over the waving sea of
parched foliage. Once, on again resuming his seat, he called
the band to his side.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What now?” questioned a man who was among the most
restive of the group. “Why not dash ahead and get out of
this confounded mud-hole? Whew! its enough to worry a
man to death in here. No air, no nothing but dust, gnats and
poisonous snakes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you ready to die?” said Waltermyer, solemnly, his
usual gay demeanor changing, and his honest face wearing an
expression of intense anxiety, if not pain.</p>

<p class='c010'>“To die? What kind of a question is that? No man is
ready to die.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yet death is around you. Hark! Do you hear that
noise?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, something is rushing through the dry reeds. One
of the horses we left, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No horse ever traveled so fast as that. Even a deer
could not keep the pace.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is it, then?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stand up on your horse and look.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I see a great cloud of thick dust—thick as if a hundred
buffalo were crowding along.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thar may be buffalo, and thar may be deer, but, my life
for it, they are not coming this way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell us, Waltermyer,” interrupted Miles Morse, “what is
it George Cary sees?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Smoke!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Smoke? I do not understand you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Smoke and fire. But you will soon learn for yourselves.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Every one sprung upright, and from the backs of their
steeds could see dense volumes of smoke, through which
flashed red tongues of living flame, and again the question
was asked as to what it could be.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The sloo is on fire!” he replied. “We are cut off—surrounded!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Great heavens, can this be true?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>“Just as true as the heaven you call upon!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then we are lost!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thousands have been before you, and not enough left of
thar bones to tell whar the fire has been.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let us hurry on—run our horses, and gain the open
ground.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You might just as well try to reach the moon. I tell you
the horse was never yet shod that could outrun perarer fire.
Even my good black, that can go two lengths to your one,
would never live in such a race.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And must we perish thus? Die a horrible death without
so much as a struggle for safety?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is gaining rapidly on us! It is coming a perfect
whirlwind of flame!” said the now agonized father. “Oh,
God, that I should perish thus! Oh, my poor, poor lost
daughter!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“At least, let us make a trial to outrun it,” said another.
“Any thing is better than standing idle.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come!” shouted his companions. “Come, we’ll dash
through and reach the high ground. What are you thinking
of, Waltermyer, standing here?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thinkin’,” blurted out the guide, “how little men like you
know of the great perarers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you are going to stay here and be burned, I am not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hold!” and the strong hand of Waltermyer was laid on
the bridle-rein, effectually checking the course of the steed,
that now, like its mates, snuffing the smoke that was fast
closing around, stood trembling, snorting and pressing against
the restraining bit, with wildly tossed head and flashing eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean? Are you mad?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not I, but you. You know Kirk Waltermyer by this
time, and ef you don’t you’ll learn him soon enough. So
hear what I say, and remember it, too. I know that the fire
is comin’—will soon be here, but the first one that offers
to stir will have a short journey, for I’ll send a bullet straight
through his skull.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But to stand still, Waltermyer,” said Miles Morse, “when
there is at least a chance of escape.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you take me for, stranger—a crazy man or a
fool?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>“Neither, but—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now you just keep cool and listen. Tie your horses
heads together, every man of you, and mind you don’t make
knots that will slip, for all the men on the perarer couldn’t
keep them from stampedin’, when the flames roar around
them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The command was obeyed, for there, as everywhere, in
the hour of danger, the master spirit controls and directs—the
firm hand and heart, and unflinching eye, tell of the pilot,
that shall, unquestioned, guide, though the course he travels
is crowded with shoals, quicksands and breaker-foaming rocks.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now bring us yours,” they said, when all the rest had
been securely fettered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not it! He ain’t none of your city-bred horses, and it
ain’t the first time that he has been surrounded by red fire
and black smoke. He knows his business here, better than
you do,” and, at a motion, and slight touch of the bridle-rein,
the noble black lay down and stretched his sinewy limbs, as
if enjoying a grateful rest. This accomplished to his satisfaction,
for he was very proud of this perfect command over
his steed—(and what true horseman is not?) he stripped himself
of his hunting-shirt, and threw it over his head, in such
a fashion that it perfectly protected his lungs from smoke;
then turning to his comrades, continued:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, men, it is time you were to work. Just now you
talked about being idle. Strip a circle clear of the grass—as
large as ever you can, and mind you do it clean. At it,
boys, hand and knife, tooth and nail! Ef you want to live,
be active;” and he set the example, tearing up the rank grass
with his immense strength, and piling it around the ring of
horses.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perchance, in his scorn at their want of knowledge, he
had waited too long, for the mad flames were leaping upon
them before they had time to make a cleared area of any
considerable dimensions. In their very faces the fire came
roaring on, darting through the black smoke, which rolled in
clouds, threatening them every moment with destruction.
Waltermyer saw that something must be done to turn it aside,
or there was but little chance for escape.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fight it! fight it! and die for the ground!” he exclaimed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>snatching the hunting-shirt from off his head, and beating out
the fire where it came nearest. “Whip it—whip it—thrash
it—out with it” he shouted, as he rushed recklessly into the
danger, burning his hands, with his hair and whiskers curling
and scorching, as he gave the command.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thar, that will do,” he continued, seeing that the danger
had passed, and the fire had swept by, leaving a black, smoky
belt of earth behind. “And now, boys, as you never saw a
perarer fire before, look! It ain’t every day you’ll see such
a sight, I can tell you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Though his words were rude, they were simply true!
Words are powerless to describe a broad prairie conflagration,
and the brush of the most gifted artist would fail to paint a
tithe of its dazzling beauty.</p>

<p class='c010'>See, where it begins, when either purpose or chance has
dropped a tiny spark into the dry herbage. A little curl of
smoke, a tiny flame struggles for a moment for life. The
slightest breath of air falls upon it—a gleam, scarcely larger
than a fire-fly among the tangled leaves, and in an instant a
lurid flame leaps forth—is kindled into a furnace-like glare,
and directly a wandering hill of flame is sweeping resistlessly
over the prairie. The harvest was ready for the flame-sickle—the
sapless and withered stalks were waiting the reaping.
Spreading like a circle in the tideless lake, the fire knows no
bounds, save when exhausted for want of fuel, it turns back
on itself and dies.</p>

<p class='c010'>See, with bounds swift and longer than an antelope ever
compassed, it o’ertops the tallest leaves—runs stealthily along
like a golden serpent, darting spitefully its forked tongue of
living flame on every side, while crackling, hissing, roaring,
its terrible writhings uncoil. In waves of living fire, flashing
from a background of dense inky smoke, it rushes on, regardless
of barriers, and scornful of bounds, a winged maelstrom
of devastation.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>
  <h2 id='CHAPTER_IX' class='c003'>CHAPTER IX.<br> <span class='c008'>TRUE HEART.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The band of Indians having Esther Morse in charge, led
by the treacherous Black Eagle, belonged to that portion of
the Dacotahs or Sioux, usually known among border men as
<i><span lang="fr">gens du large</span></i>, to distinguish them from the <i><span lang="fr">gens du lac</span></i>, who
lived in villages on the borders of Spirit Lake, and kept themselves
aloof, in a very great degree, from both plunder and
murder. Scarcely divining the object of their leader in conducting
them through the rocky mountain passes, while
another portion had been sent off to attack the train of the
white men, and totally ignorant of his plans, they yet followed
blindly on, believing that the end would compensate them for
their toil.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was upon the very crest of a rocky spur of the mountain
that he had raised the war-cry of the tribe, intending only
that it should lure the Mormon still deeper into the fastnesses,
and so place him completely at his mercy, either for the disgorgement
of hoarded gold, or it might be for total robbery.
Very much to his surprise, a single clear, ringing voice,
powerful as a trumpet, answered from a still higher point,
and a single horseman was seen picking his way down the
steep mountain side, holding every movement clearly within
the range of his vision.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was not wonderful that an object like this, appearing
suddenly in that lonesome place, should startle the superstitious
men who composed Black Eagle’s band. For an instant
they huddled close together, watching the horseman with a
wild look of terror, thinking him the Manitou of the mountain,
or some messenger sent from the Walham Tanka, or
Great Spirit that dwells on high, who smiles in the sunshine,
or frowns in the thunder-cloud, whispers in the morning wind,
or rolls his anger over the earth in the rushing tornado.</p>

<p class='c010'>Esther Morse watched the horseman with suspended
breath, as he rode along the verge of the beetling cliff. To
her vivid imagination, he seemed more like a warrior of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>air, descending from the fleecy clouds, than a mortal being.
Then, as he descended toward them, and became more distinctly
visible, her fancy returned to earth, and she could
but regard him as a knight of romance coming to her rescue,
with eagle plumes, tinged with sunlight, his shield shaped
with golden bars.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was strange, but even in that moment, Esther forgot
her peril, her bonds, and her captivity. Strange, and yet is
not our being twin-mated? Are we not composed of widely
different natures—different as bright day from ebon night,
yet, like them, bound in indissoluble fetters? One the soaring
spirit—the mystical essence of immortality, and the other, the
dull and sluggish clay that shall never know aught of eternal
life; the ethereal essence of endless being, and the lifeless
clod of the valley; the foreshadowing of things to come, and
the inanimate pitcher that shall yet be broken at the well;
the subtle lightning of Divinity, and the gross longings of
dust. Ah! well, indeed it is, that:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The soul itself dissolving from clay fetters, heavy, dreary,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With spirit wings can travel the land of dread and doubt;</div>
      <div class='line'>Can revel in the brightness, when fainting and earth-weary,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And for itself the secret of the mystery find out.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>A short descent, and the turning of a sudden curve
brought horse and rider to the plateau upon which the band
of Black Eagle were resting. With the silent greeting, usual
among the red-men, he was received, and yet, more than one
lip murmured audibly—Osse ’o.</p>

<p class='c010'>Esther Morse watched his movements with keen interest.
There was something kingly in his presence, and commanding
in his movements, that convinced her he was a man of
authority among the Indians. His dress partook more of a
white hunter’s, than that of a Dacotah chief. The saddle
and decorations of his horse bore evidence of having been
manufactured by the hands of an artist. His dress and moccasins
were of finely-dressed doeskin; a cap of soft fur sat
easily on his head, surmounted by a single eagle’s plume;
around his neck, hanging upon his bosom, as the Indians
usually wear some favorite ornament, was a small shield,
exquisitely engraved, and studded with silver knobs. Silver-mounted
pistols were secured by a crimson sash, that girded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>his waist, and in his hand he poised a spear of finer workmanship
than ever came from savage hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>Surely this man was either an exquisite in his tribe or a
man of wonderful authority—no warrior ever displayed a form
more lithe and sinewy. His eyes were large, bright, and of
a color rare among the Indians. In the graded avenue or the
broad prairie it would have been difficult to match him in
that haughty grace which gives command and insures respect.
There was a softness, too, in his deep, rich voice which seemed
inconsistent with his wild life, and once, when he turned to
look upon Esther, an encouraging smile stole over his lips, a
thing so unusual with his people that the young girl felt her
heart beating quick with wild hopes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The warriors of the Dacotahs are wandering far from
their wigwams,” he said, addressing Black Eagle, and looking
with piercing eye around the circle of his followers as if he
read the motive of their journey.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The moccasins of Osse ’o are not often heard so far from
the Spirit Lake,” was the evasive response.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The prairie is open to every one. The <i><span lang="fr">gens du large</span></i>
may roam unquestioned to worship the Manitou in the giant
caves of the mountain.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My brother is a <i><span lang="fr">gens du lac</span></i>. Has he been seeking the
Great Spirit?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When the war-cry of the Dacotahs rung upon his ears he
thought himself alone with the spirits of the mountain. But
why are the horses of the Black Eagle turned toward the setting
sun? The trail they are following leads away from their
squaws and little ones.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The white man has many hoofs. His pouch is filled with
the red gold. The Dacotahs are poor. The buffalo and deer
have been driven from his hunting-grounds—the beaver and
otter from the stream. The wild horse has fled before the fire-weapon
of the pale-face—the green maize is cut down beneath
the roll of his iron-shod wheels. The children of the prairie
seek food for their little ones in vain. The wigwam is empty.
The pale-face robbed the Dacotah and they but take their
own back again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The words of Black Eagle are like the trail of the serpent,
crooked and full of guile. His tongue is forked and his feet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>have lost the trail of truth. There is neither hoof nor food
of the pale man in his keeping.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They were beaten off—the pale-faces were thick as the
berries of the mahnononee.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The kernels of the wild rice are countless. The Dacotah
is not a mole that runs blindly into a trap. The fire-weapons
of the pale-face are death. Where are the wounded and the
dead among the red-men?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Quailing as Black Eagle did in heart before this straightforward
questioning, and well aware that the stranger knew
the truth of the matter, he yet prevaricated:</p>

<p class='c010'>“The red-men fled. When they saw that the pale-face
would sweep them from the earth, they—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stole this innocent girl and fled like cowardly wolves.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bitter indeed was the taunt contained in the words, and the
iron frame of the Black Eagle shook with the fury of his rage—a
rage that he dared not exhibit while the cool, unflinching
eye of Osse ’o was upon him—though he would not for a
moment hesitate to seek revenge when he could do so in
safety to himself. When in the hour of darkness he could
strike assassin-like, or from some lurking-place send the stone-tipped
arrow on its deadly mission, Black Eagle never hesitated;
but now his coward eyes sunk under the gaze fixed
upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What was your purpose in taking the girl?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gold, gold.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you brought her here into the almost pathless mountains,
expecting to find those here who would give you gold?”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was another home thrust, and even those who had been
the firm followers of Black Eagle began to see that he had
some secret purpose in leading them thither. A quick suspicion
that they had been imposed upon and detained for the
selfish purpose of their chief, when they might have been
plundering the train, or following in the trail of the Mormons,
picking off their cattle as opportunity offered, or by
some <em>coup de main</em> stampeded their horses, disturbed them
greatly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” replied Black Eagle, who had taken time to consider,
for he dared not mention the Mormons as being in any way
connected with his plan, “No; but the Dacotahs are not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>fools! They leave not a plain and open trail. The paths
through the mountains are known to them. They turn not
from the high precipice or grow faint on the upward path.
Their enemies can not follow. True Heart has not followed
the hunting so little that he needs to be told of these things.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Unbind the pale-face!”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the first words the poor prisoner could understand,
the former conversation having been carried on in the Indian
language. But now she felt that she had gained a protector,
if not a friend, and with tears in her eyes she ventured to
thank him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The tongue of the pale-face,” he replied, “is twisted to
the flattering language of her tribe. It has learned to belie
her heart,” and he turned hastily away as if in anger.</p>

<p class='c010'>The idol which Esther had raised so suddenly in her imagination
was shivered to atoms in a single moment; the man’s
voice, so changed and cold, struck a chill to her heart. Notwithstanding,
she was very grateful for relief from her bonds,
and springing to the ground, felt an exquisite relief in her
freedom of limb. An Indian, at the command of her deliverer,
went to a little spring that gushed through clustering ferns
and tall grasses from a cleft in the rock behind them, and filling
a birchen cup with water, brought it all cool and sparkling
for her to drink. Another hastened to supply her with
food, and Osse ’o took a softly-dressed bear-skin from his
saddle, and throwing it at her feet, motioned her to rest.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was something in the thoughtful kindness of this
action that filled her with gratitude again. She lifted her
eyes to his face but did not venture to speak. She saw that
the man was evidently concealing his real character. That
he could not be an Indian was her first thought; but as she
looked again, the idea was discarded, for both color and feature
bore too strong proof of his descent to admit of doubt.
But why should he be so kind? It was altogether foreign to
the red-man’s nature. Could he also think of making her his
bride? Had she unawares attracted two savage lovers, who
wished for a white slave in their wigwam? Again the old
fear came upon her, and with throbbing heart she bent her
head and gave way to a passionate burst of tears. But hope
sprung to her heart again. She wiped the tears from her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>eyes, and raising her head saw Osse ’o standing with folded
arms by her side.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let the maiden of the snowy skin dry her tears,” he
said; “they will wash all the roses from her cheeks. When
the great and good Manitou placed the red-men on the prairies
he did not give them all hearts of stone.” Then, as if
swayed by some sudden impulse he again turned sternly away.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will Osse ’o rob the Black Eagle of his prize?” When
Black Eagle asked this question True Heart stood directly
before him upon the very brink of the precipice, so near
that a touch would have sent him headlong to his death. He
did not answer, but stood with his arms folded, looking out
upon the prairie.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let the Dacotahs scatter themselves on the mountain and
watch the coming of the pale-face,” replied Osse ’o, without
deigning to answer the question, until it was repeated imperatively.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My brother knows that Osse ’o never stains his soul with
blood—that he keeps his hand free from plunder.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why then come between me and my prisoner?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is the Black Eagle afraid that a feeble girl will escape
when surrounded by his warriors? Is he a coward that he
binds her as he would a strong man at the stake?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Does he think her tribe will pay him more gold when
they know that he has tortured her without cause?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No! But he does what he likes with his own prisoners,
and allows no man to interfere.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The taunt of Black Eagle falls like the wind upon the
ears of Osse ’o. He hears it not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Standing as the Eagle did a step in the rear of his companion,
it required but the raising of a hand to gratify his
malice—to revenge the insults he had received and free himself
forever from molestation. This was far too good an
opportunity to be lost—too important a moment to be neglected.
The brawny arm was raised—was descending—at the
instant Osse ’o turned and saw the movement, though little
dreaming of the purpose.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What does my brother see that he points far away upon
the prairie?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>“The buffalo and the deer are being driven by the Manitou
of fire!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“True; but far beyond the rolling smoke the train of the
pale-face winds along, like a white serpent. The hoofs are
many for they leave behind them a long trail of dust.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Like the buzzards, they cover the hunting-ground of the
red-man; like the Manitou of starvation, they leave neither
food nor grass behind.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Like them, the Dacotahs can raise the golden grain—the
rustling maize, and—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And be slaves! The Great Manitou gave to the children
of the pale-face the grain for his squaws and little ones; but
to the children of the prairie he gave the hunting-grounds.
When the Dacotahs bow their neck to the yoke, like the
cattle of the pale-face, then will their glory depart, the totem
be torn from their breasts—their bows broken, their arrows
headless, and their glory depart forever!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When the red-man no more reddens his hand in blood—when
the torture at the stake is forgotten, and no scalp-locks
fringe his leggins, there will—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Osse ’o is always talking peace. He is a coward, and
dare not go in the war!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Osse ’o turned from his companion, with a smile of scorn
curving his lips. Once more folding his arms, he looked
forth on the distant prairie, now a sea of surging smoke and
flame.</p>

<p class='c010'>Black Eagle crept close behind him; slowly his arm was
uplifted. A thrilling cry broke from the white girl: it was
too late! The blow fell with crushing force on the head of
Osse ’o as it was slightly bent, gazing into the distance. The
powerful form of the young chief tottered, his arms were flung
wildly out, and he fell headlong over the precipice into the
horrible abyss below.</p>

<p class='c010'>Black Eagle gave a low, exultant cry; and springing upon
the captive girl, lifted her to the white horse that Osse ’o had
ridden down to the cliff. Regardless of her shrieks and
struggles, he bound her firmly to the saddle; and calling to
his warriors, prepared to descend the mountain. The savages
looked astonished when they saw the young girl on Osse ’o’s
horse, and Black Eagle standing by her, alone.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>The chief saw discontent in their eyes, and condescended
to explain.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Osse ’o has fallen over the cliff,” he said; “his foot was
not sure on the path. He was like an eagle with broken
claws. Let him go.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was no one to contradict this monstrous falsehood;
for Esther had fainted on the saddle to which she was bound.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='CHAPTER_X' class='c003'>CHAPTER X.<br> <span class='c008'>CANT—A STRUGGLE—A SUDDEN DISAPPEARANCE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Though stunned by his fall, and covered with wounds,
fortunately for him not of a serious character, the Mormon
was lifted by his companions from the poor horse that had
been killed by the fall—a noble brute sacrificed to save the
life of a far less noble man—and laid upon a shelving rock.
No remedies were at hand, save the gushing water that bubbled
from the base, and the flask that he always carried with
him; but the stimulus, liberally supplied, soon restored him.
Not a single thought did this man give to his truly providential
escape—not one word of thanks to the God whose hand
had saved him from a sudden and horrible death—a literal
crushing out of brain and heart—a total annihilation of body!</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where’s my horse?” was the first question that passed
his lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dead.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The brute! to fall, and nearly crush me, when I was so
near—”</p>

<p class='c010'>His tongue had almost betrayed him into the revelation of
his secret; but he checked it in time, and continued:</p>

<p class='c010'>“The prophet of the Lord was saved for the great work,
and it is requisite that he be up and doing. Bretheren, in
this day’s work you can see one of the miracles written of
on the ten golden plates—one such as only those on whom
the mantle of the Prophet Joseph has fallen.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Were there ever blasphemous words like these uttered in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>a situation so painful? Was there ever man who had just
faced a violent death capable of such hypocrisy?</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yea, of a verity,” he continued, “we must be up and
doing; for is it not written that we should let our lights
shine? The horse has been given to the buzzards of the
valley, but the spirit that is within man rises superior to the
accidents of the moment. It is for him both to will and to
do—to suffer and grow strong. Bretheren, give me a little
more of the drink that is medicine in the hour of pain!
Bretheren, the book revealed to the martyr Joseph teaches
that the grossest sin of earth is disobedience, and shall never
know the joys and privileges of the Latter Day Saints. Anathemas
shall be heaped like coals of living fire upon the heads
of the Gentiles who disbelieve! The keys of the kingdom
were given to the rulers; they hold them in their hands,
and woe be to him who disobeys! Into outer darkness shall
they be cast who hearken and yet murmur!”</p>

<p class='c010'>How much longer he would have indulged in this kind of
sermonizing it would have been difficult to determine, had
not one of the listeners, possessed of more courage and less
blind belief than the others, interrupted him:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Take my horse, Elder; he is sure-footed and strong. It
is past noon, and unless the band moves on, we shall not only
be caught in the darkness, but lose all chance of overtaking
the Indians.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At any other time the Mormon would have been sorely
displeased with the interruption and advice; but now he
thought only of gaining the prize he had ventured so much
for, and eagerly caught at the proposition.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It shall be as you say; and when the hour comes that
our journey is finished—when the lamb of the Gentiles that
has been carried away by the wolves of the Sioux shall
again be restored unto her people—when her soul is secure
in the fold of the saints, then will I further instruct you in
the tenets of the Prophet, whose spirit was translated from
the earth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mount, then, and—”</p>

<p class='c010'>The sound as of some large body rushing through the air,
tearing through the slender bushes, struggling for life on the
side of the rocky cañon, fell upon their ears, and the foot of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>the Mormon was stayed as he placed it in the stirrup.
Different far from the fall of the huge stones was this strange
noise; and for a moment they all stood doubtful and terrified.
Urged on, however, by the Elder, they at length advanced.
As they turned the point ahead, the body of an
Indian, swinging directly over the ragged rocks, suspended
by a slender root, and with fully a hundred feet between
him and the bottom, met their appalled gaze.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is one of your red-skins,” cried Elder Thomas,
“punished for his crimes even while on the earth!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shall we not try to save him?” asked one of his companions.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is not given unto the Lord’s anointed to stoop to that
which is unclean.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But he is a man, and will be dashed to atoms.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is an Indian.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you will not let him hang in that awful way? See I
the root to which he clings is parting! The earth is breaking
away from around it; and then—great heavens! he is—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, not gone! and yet it would be monstrous to leave
him in such danger. I, even I, will save him, as did the
Gentiles the Prophet Joseph!”—and snatching a rifle from
one of his nearest followers, he raised it, and fired.</p>

<p class='c010'>The report, and the swift whizzing of the bullet as it cut
the air, awoke the countless echoes of the rocky cañon with
grand reverberations; and the smoke, lifting like a fleecy
vail, showed them that the Indian had disappeared. A stone,
loosened from its scanty earth-bed, most probably by his fall,
rolled down to their very feet; but what had become of the
swarthy form that a moment before hung above the abyss,
suspended, as if by a thread.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The ravens will find him in the holes of the rocks,” said
Thomas, coolly returning the rifle to its owner, and without
bestowing the slightest attention on the horror that ran
through the group at this unnatural murder.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And now, bretheren, not forgetting the glory of the Prophet,
let us hasten onward and save the dove from the snares
of the savage fowler.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Strange, indeed, would it have been if sadness and  silence
had not followed a brutal murder like this. As Thomas led
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>the way, the remainder followed, not only dumb with
astonishment, but sorely grieved that one they had looked
upon with such reverential love, should not only stain Christianity
and manhood, but even common humanity with a
crime so terrible—that the saint should disappear in the
murderer, and the garments of regular succession from the
immaculate Joseph should be steeped in crime. Ah! could
the blinding scales but have fallen from the eyes of “the
faithful” everywhere, how soon Salt Lake would be a city
of ashes, and the “beautiful valley” again a wilderness.
When the <em>true religion</em> is stripped of cant, hypocrisy, forms
and idle ceremonies, how beautiful in its simplicity will the
journey be that the soul must travel to reach the gardens of
eternal sunshine, and purity, and love, beyond “the river.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A small white flag, waving in advance, instantly fixed the
attention of the party. It was a strange symbol in that
lonely place, and much more so when held, as it was now,
in the hands of a lone Indian. All except the Elder stopped
in astonishment, doubtful how to act, but he recognized in
the bearer his ally the Black Eagle, and instantly commanding
a halt, proceeded on foot to ascertain the meaning of his
appearance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Has my white brother,” began the Indian, as soon as the
other was at his side, “seen the body of a Dacotah lying
among the rocks?” Certain as he was that no one could
have fallen like Osse ’o, without being dashed into a thousand
atoms, yet he wished to assure himself of the fact by ocular
proof. He even desired to pay the last rites of burial to the
corpse, knowing well that it would be to his own benefit, and
stand between him and suspicion with the tribe by whom the
chieftain was more than loved.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I saw an Indian hanging by a root from the precipice,
and was going to help him, when all of a sudden he fell, and
was crushed at the foot of the rocks.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Black Eagle could not well doubt the story, for, base as he
was, the Indian would have scorned to leave his worst enemy
in a situation so terrible. The savage would have rescued
him, even if an hour afterward he had sought his scalp, and
therefore had no suspicion of the white man. If he had
dreamed of what had passed, the lone rock upon which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>stood would have been the theater of a second crime, and the
first murderer would have executed fearful vengeance upon
the second.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was Osse ’o of the Dacotahs,” he continued, after his
careful scrutiny of the Mormon had ceased. “We were standing
together upon the cliff. He was looking over the prairie—the
rock was treacherous and broke from under him. He
fell before the arm of his brother, Black Eagle, could save
him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, it’s to be regretted.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He has gone to the happy hunting-grounds. The swift
canoe has ferried him over the dark waters of the river of
death, and his song is heard in the flowery prairies of the
Great Manitou.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“May he rest in peace! And now, about the girl?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Has my pale brother been trying strength with the giant
bear of the mountains?” was the evasive question, as the
Indian glanced at the torn garments of the Mormon.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; my horse fell with me—that’s all. But the girl?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The trail upon the steep hillside is not for the warriors
of the pale-face. The Manitou gave them to his red children.
Their foot is sure—their horses trained to the rugged path.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, well, I’ve no time for words about it. Have you
brought the girl as you promised?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Has the pale-face brought the yellow dust that his people
have made a great Manitou? Has he remembered the gold?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; let me but get the girl into my power, and it shall
be yours.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will he let his red brother look upon the gold? It is
bright as the sun, and he longs to see it shine.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When I see the girl, then—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look!” and the Indian led him forward a few steps and
pointed into a little valley, apart from the main one, and
closely screened by high rocks.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Surely it is the Lily of the Valley,” exclaimed the Mormon,
clasping his hands. “Mounted upon a milk-white
steed, she cometh to gladden the soul, as sweet waters doth
the thirsty earth. She is fair as the Cedar of Lebanon, and
the—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gold!” interrupted Black Eagle.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>With reluctance, the Mormon doled out half the required
sum. It was hard to part with it, but harder still to give up
the vision he had indulged in so long.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is the tongue of the pale-face crooked? Are his eyes
dim that he can not see? Have his fingers forgotten how to
count?” asked the Indian, somewhat savagely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no, it is all right. When—”</p>

<p class='c010'>A shrill whistle rung through the valley, and Black Eagle
cut the explanation short.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My brothers call. The Black Eagle will lead his warriors
out of the little valley into the broad road. Then let
the pale-face come and get the young squaw for his wigwam.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come and get her?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did he not so tell the red sachem?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“True, I had forgotten. Mind your men don’t fire. I
have told my men not to shoot. Let there be a sort of a
sham fight, and as soon as I have got the girl, you can come
quietly to me, and I will pay you even more than I promised.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Without another audible word the Indian departed, but
his thoughts were the embodiment of treachery. The white
man had gold—should it not be his? The girl was fair—should
she not fill his wigwam far away by the margin of Spirit
Lake? The companions of the Mormon should only play
with their weapons—should his be so careful? They were
the enemies of his race—should not their scalps hang in the
wigwams of the Dacotahs? Ah! it was a great temptation
for a savage warrior, and little faith could be put in his promises
when red gold, and rich plunder, and a snowy bride, were
luring him to the accomplishment of the very things his
nature panted after.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Indian to the fragment of his tribe, and the white man
to his companions, and again both parties proceeded, each
leader giving a far different version of the meeting, and each
one shaping it to suit his own ends. A scant mile, and they
were brought into full view—neither rock, tree or hill obscured
their vision.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There they go, the cowardly thieves,” shouted the Mormon,
as he waved his little troop on.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There come the false warriors of your tribe,” whispered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>the Black Eagle, in the ears of the shrinking, yet hopeful girl—shrinking
from him and hopeful of rescue. “Yes, like
wolves, they come, but let the maiden beware. The knife
of the Black Eagle is keen-edged and his tomahawk heavy—his
bow-string is strong, so is his arm. Let her not try to
leave his side, or—”</p>

<p class='c010'>The shouts of the Mormons urging on their steeds, and the
desperate rush of the spur-driven brutes, admitted of no
further threatening. The ranks of the Indians were formed
to resist the attack, and their arrows flew thick as hail, but,
purposely aimed too high, passed over the heads of the
white men. So also was it with the bullets of their adversaries.
It was soon front to front, and hand to hand, and
seemed more like a bloodless tournament—a base and senseless
imitation, gotten up as a foolish aping of the chivalry
of olden times, than the meeting of two races that ever have
and ever will be enemies. But this rough play could not
long continue without arousing fierce passions—fierce hands
clutching the ready weapons in earnest. One of the Mormons,
more powerful and better mounted than the rest, succeeded
in breaking the ranks of the Indians, and gaining the
side of Black Eagle, who had remained in the rear to keep
guard over the girl. It was Elder Thomas who should have
been there—he was to have been the savior, and loud he
commanded his impetuous follower to turn back. Possibly,
he was unheard in the din of the, as yet, bloodless strife. At
any rate, he was disregarded, for the brawny Mormon saw
the girl and dashed to her side, perfectly regardless of all
the opposition that attempted to stay his course.</p>

<p class='c010'>“By heaven!” he shouted, “it’s the very gal that we used
to see, and that sung so sweet to us at Laramie. Down with
the cursed red-skins, boys! Give them no quarter, the infernal
brutes!” and his pistol-butt struck the Black Eagle full
upon the skull, and leveled him to the earth in a moment.</p>

<p class='c010'>Vain now were all attempts at control. A fierce blow had
been struck; a chief of the Dacotahs hurled from his horse.
In less than a minute, knife and pistol were doing their
deadly work. Wildly pealed the fierce battle-cry of the
savage; loudly and clearly it was answered by the challenge
of the white man. The innocent trial of strength had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>changed, quick as thought, into the fearful tumult of the
battle-field. Now, death’s dark hounds must lap their fill of
human blood!</p>

<p class='c010'>But it was of short duration. The superior skill, strength
and weapons of the white man could not long be withstood,
and, with many wounded though none killed, the Indians
withdrew, commanded still by the Black Eagle. The chief
had been but stunned for a moment, and soon separated himself
from the <i><span lang="fr">melée</span></i>. But it was to find himself standing face
to face with Elder Thomas, both effectually cut off by the
combatants from the girl. The narrow valley denied them
footing on either side, and when, at length, they had succeeded
in drawing off their followers, they looked in vain for milk-white
horse or snowy prisoner! They had vanished, as if
the earth had swallowed them.</p>

<p class='c010'>In sullen silence the parties of the white and red-man separated,
but each with dark thoughts of revenge at heart. Ah,
many a peaceful traveler has paid, with life, the price of that
day’s work. Many an unwary man has been shot from
behind rocks and trees—has died with the poisoned arrow
festering in his side; or, worse perchance still, been robbed
of all, and left to lingering death by starvation. And many
a red-man, too, has been shot down in very wantonness—has
fled from his burning wigwam, and seen all he loved perish,
literally butchered by bullet and flame, like sheep in the
shambles. Yes, the Oregon trail is beaten down hard as iron
with the hoofs and wheels of the thousands of emigrants, but
so, also, is it lined upon the map with blood.</p>

  <h2 id='CHAPTER_XI' class='c003'>CHAPTER XI.<br> <span class='c008'>PARTING—A LONELY RIDE—A NIGHT STORM IN THE MOUNTAINS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Rapid riding soon brought the party of Waltermyer to the
first swell of the mountain. A rest here was necessary, but the
frontiersman granted it grudgingly, for his iron frame despised
repose when any exciting purpose urged him forward. With
the horse he was master of, an animal that between sun and
sun had coursed his hundred miles, it was very difficult for
him to realize that the steeds of others could grow faint upon
so short a trail. But his keen eye told him that some of
these poor wretches, at least, were sorely distressed, and his
kind heart would not permit of cruelty to the meanest beast
alive; yet he chafed at the moments thus wasted, as he said,
when one in whom he had become so strangely interested was
a prisoner, either with the Indians, or—and, in his view of the
matter, far worse—the Mormons.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Lite, boys, lite,” was his command, “and give your horses
a good rubbin’ down, though it ain’t of much use, neither,
nussin’ up such good for nothin’ but pullin’ beasts. Thar
isn’t five miles an hour left in any one of them, and ef we
catch the red-skins, we’ll have to travel faster than that by a
considerable sight. But give them a good rubbin’ down, and,
ef worst comes to worst, it will help them to get back to the
train.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you think, Waltermyer, that there is little chance
of overtaking them?” asked the anxious father.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yours, yes. And I might as well tell you the truth,
stranger, now as any time. I’ve kept it back because I was
rale sorry for you, and couldn’t find words soft enough. Kirk
Waltermyer calls himself a man, but he has a woman’s heart
about some things, and when he sees a fine old gray-headed
chap like you a-weepin’ for a daughter, he can’t help thinkin’
of a sister he had once—a little blue-eyed darlin’, that went to
sleep when the early snow-flakes were fallin’, and never woke
again.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>The stout frontiersman drew a hand across his eyes to free
them from the tears that swelled into them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“God knows how much I love Esther, and—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Esther? Yes, I had almost forgotten; but the little child
that the minister said had gone to heaven to be an angel—them
war his own words, stranger—was named Esther.
Est—little Est, I used to call her, and—but, stranger,” and his
words were toned down into a deeply-breathed whisper, as if
coming from the very bottom of his heart, “but, stranger, do
you think a man that has lived the life I have can ever go
thar?” his finger was pointed reverently upward as he spoke,
and an anxious glance shone out through his tears.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Heaven is ever in sight, my friend. It is as near to you
here in the wilderness, as if you lived within the sound of
church-going bells.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stranger, I thank you.” He wrung the hand of Morse
convulsively, and then continued: “Yes, stranger, Kirk Waltermyer,
thanks you, and that is a thing he doesn’t often do,
for he has lived with Diggers and Greasers until he has got to
be a’most as unpolite as they are. I have often thought of
this thing when ridin’ along alone over the wide perarers, but
never had any schoolin’, and, therefore, couldn’t make up my
mind. Sometimes, stranger, I have thought I heard that far-off
bell tolling again, just as it did when they laid poor little
Est in the ground. And then again, when campin’ by myself—when
layin’ out nights, with nothin’ under me but the bare
ground, and nothin’ over me but the starry blanket they call
heaven, I have thought I could see her blue eyes looking
down upon me, and have heard her whisper, just as she used
to do, ‘Now I lay me down.’ I’ve forgotten the rest,
stranger, but I always try to be better afterward, for poor
little Est’s sake.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was something so pitiful in the sorrow of the hardy
frontiersman, so unusual and different from any that he had
before seen, that Miles Morse felt that the accustomed common
expressions of condolence would be entirely out of place, and
wisely refrained from giving them utterance. Ah, when such
men weep—when their strong natures are melted into tears,
be sure the grief is deep, and far too sacred for human cure.
Believe, full surely, that there is a spot somewhere, concealed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>though it be from public gaze, a sacred cleft in which a tiny
flower is budding for heaven.</p>

<p class='c010'>Incompetent to give sympathy, there remained but one
way to give Waltermyer relief, that of changing the subject,
and this Morse hastened to do, believing that his volatile
nature would soon recover. And in this he was right. A
prairie life is one of constant changes and excitement. Few
are the moments that can be spared from watchfulness, amid
its ever-present danger, to give to regret. The tear must be
dashed from the eye to sight the deadly rifle, and the hand
that is performing the last acts of affection for the departed
must turn hastily away for self-protection. It is a school, the
like of which there is not elsewhere on earth, for training men
to be self-reliant, brave to recklessness, scornful of privation,
uncaring for hardship, and steady and unquailing in the hour
of strife. Turn to the blood-written records of Henry, Donelson,
Pittsburg Landing, and read there the proof of the
matchless daring, unflinching bravery, and almost hopeless
victories won by our frontiersmen—the hardy, prairie-nurtured
and trained gladiators of the West.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You were going to tell me,” continued Morse, after a
pause that he deemed sufficient to allow the turbulent waters
in the breast of Waltermyer to subside, “you were going to
tell me something that you couldn’t find words to express.
This is what you were saying.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Soft words, stranger, soft words. Yes, I was, but poor little
Est put it all out of my mind. Forget it, and don’t think me
a baby for cryin’ about one who has been so long dead.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Forget it? I think the better of you for it. It shows
you have a heart, and that it is in the right place. No brave
or true man forgets his little ones who are sleeping beneath
the cold sod of the valley.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Truer words you never spoke, and the memory of that
dear little child that God took to be a bright-winged angel—yes,
them was the very words the old minister used—has kept
me from many a sin out on the frontier.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“May it always do so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And now, then, about what I was a-goin’ to say. Ef I
don’t word it softly, stranger, you must forgive me, for it’s the
tongue and not the heart.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>“You need no apology. Go on, friend.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Friend, yes. Waal, I will try to earn that name. And
now, stranger, what I was a-goin’ to say was this. <em>You can’t
follow this trail any longer.</em>”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not follow the trail? You must be mad.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no. I only wish I was. You’re an old man, and
the hard ridin’ ana hot work we’ve had is tellin’ on you.
You need rest and must have it or you will die right out.
Stranger, a horse or a deer that outruns its strength falls suddenly.
I know the nature of the beasts and I allow its just
the same with humans. Then, too, you haven’t a horse in
the bull crowd that could stand an hour’s journey in the
mountings. Besides it will soon be dark—dark as a pile of
black snakes, for thar is no moon to-night, and he who rides
must have a sure hand and an eye that is used to followin’
trails.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Alas, you but speak the truth. But my daughter? My
poor, poor child?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Didn’t you say just now that the Lord was on the perarer
the same as in the great cities? I believe you did, and I
believe it’s gospel truth. But your Esther shall not want a
friend, if it was only for the sake of the poor little child that
was named for her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But what shall I do?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You and the boys must stop here. When it gets to be
dark you will see the light from the fires of your train yender.
La Moine would never pass that camping-ground. It’s
a cl’ar road—no sloos or rocks between, and you ought
to ride it in two hours. I’ve done it many a time in half
the time. You must go there and tell the Frenchman that
Kirk Waltermyer says he mustn’t move until he hears from
him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But suppose any accident should happen to you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Accident! Well, stranger, thar mought be such a thing,
that’s a fact, but I don’t believe it,” and he laughed as if disaster
to him was an utter impossibility. “Anyhow, you keep
quiet thar, and if I don’t come back within three days and
bring your daughter safe and sound, tell La Moine to take the
back track, hunt up my bones and bring them in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And I?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>“Must trust in heaven. Kirk Waltermyer will have done
all that was possible for man to do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe it must be as you say. The horses, poor things,
are worn out, and I feel that I could not long endure riding.
But had you not better take some of the boys with you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not a single one. They would only bother me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Go, then, friend, and if you do not come back within three
days I myself will follow, and never rest until I have found
you if alive, and if dead, which kind heaven avert—make for
you a grave.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Again a tear stood in the eye of Waltermyer. He strove
to speak, but the words were lost in his throat. A strong,
hearty shake of the hand was the only thanks he was able to
return, then, as if fearing to trust himself further, he whistled
his horse to his side, sprung upon his back without touching
the stirrup, and with a wave of his hand dashed toward the
frowning steeps and disappeared.</p>

<p class='c010'>The disconsolate parent followed his advice, and just as the
guard was changed at midnight, reached the train—there to
relate the story of their wanderings—hear of the attack and
repulse of the Indians, and then, after partaking of food and
drink, to fall into the dreamless, all-forgetting slumber that
follows arduous toil.</p>

<p class='c010'>Waltermyer reached the rocky bed of the cañon, muffled
his horse’s feet so as to deaden as much as possible the sound
of his footsteps without lessening his speed or rendering him
liable to fall. He stripped his steed of every thing except his
bridle, making his load easy as possible, then again mounting
urged him forward. The twilight was just beginning to
gather around him when he parted from his comrades, and
soon the shadows settled thickly in his path. Blacker still
they became until night had enveloped the earth in a starless,
moonless vail.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Black as a mounting of black minks,” muttered the lone
rider to himself, and then, as if pleased with the idea, he continued:
“and I reckon them reptiles are e’en a-most as black
as you are, Star,” and he patted the neck of his horse. “How
I pity any one that has to ride in such a night. Ef that gal
is abroad now she will—as I live ef it hain’t a-goin’ to rain,
too. Thar fell a drop—a great, big drop pat on my hand.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Hark! that rumblin’ way up in the hills means thunder and
nothin’ else. Waal, waal, we’re goin’ to have a night of it,
and I allow it’s lucky that I didn’t bring them green boys
along with me. Softly, pet—steady, boy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A sudden flash—a living chain of fire that flashed before
the horse, dazzling and blinding, had for an instant startled
him, and it needed both voice and rein of the master to control
him for a moment; but when another followed and the rolling
thunder shook the very rocks beneath his feet, he was calm,
and, unmoved, felt his way along the dangerous path. Felt,
for even the eyes of the quadruped will fail when the flood-gates
of a night storm are suddenly thrown open and the lurid
glare of lightning fills earth and sky.</p>

<p class='c010'>The slowly-dropping rain became a torrent, and the wind,
aroused from its slumber in the hills, came raving through the
rain, and howled a terrible anthem among the mountains.
Moaning it crept among the crevices in the rock, and howling
it swept through the high-walled cañon, and wrestled with
the tortured trees and shook the granite portals of the mountain.
Catching the huge drops in its embrace, it whirled them
in fleecy mist aloft—ragged, torn, drifting away into the black
darkness. The deep-worn gulleys in the gray old rocks were
aflood with water—the cañon’s floor a roaring river, and still
the pitiless wind-driven sleet fell deluge-like. Along the inky
sky the lightning played, flashing its red bolts—twining in
many a fantastic link its burnished gold—tinging the cloudy
rifts with shining white, and lighting up cavern and crevice
as with shooting star-light. Oh! it was grandly sublime!—a
panorama of light and blackness—of gloom and brightness—of
blackest chaos and of burning light, and shown to such
music as the world can only know when the fingers of Jehovah
plays upon the lightning-strings, and the thunder-gun of
heaven is fired from the murky battlements of the whirlwind.
Such was the mountain storm in which the frontiersman
found himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! night, and storm, and darkness, ye are wondrous
strong,” sung he of the gloomy lyre years ago, and there,
where Jura answered, came such sounds and flashing bolts
as rung around the head of that brave frontiersman as he
bowed his head to the storm, thinking, save now and then of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>the little one that was above, of the one below, who might
even then be forced by savage warriors to struggle with the
tempest as he was doing.</p>

<p class='c010'>But there was little of written poetry in Waltermyer, and
if there had been, custom had blunted his taste for the beauty
of a night thunder-storm in the wilderness. He knew the
danger of the path that he was traveling at any time—even
in the daylight—but now? Death was lurking beneath every
footfall. And yet, knowing this, he gave no thought to his
own safety or made any effort to escape the beating force of
the storm. The mad rushing of the rain, the roaring of the
angry thunder or the blinding glare of the lightning was
nothing to him. A girl, a feeble girl, was waiting for him to
rescue her from the hands of savage warriors, and all the fiends
of the storm could not have forced him to pause for his own
safety. Besides, he knew that Indian warriors would not
travel on a night like that, and if she was still in their hands,
he could gain upon them. Shrewdly surmising at what point
and under what shelter they would pause, he kept on his dangerous
way.</p>

<p class='c010'>His horse stumbled; he sprung to the ground—if such a
flinty floor could so be called—in an instant, and removed the
mufflings from the animal’s feet. Then, as the path became
more steep, he led him carefully—trying every step before he
ventured his weight upon it. And thus, brave heart, he
moved still slowly along, while the sky was ablaze and the
thunder boomed in his ear, mingled with the shrill whistle of
the wind, the rattle of the falling rain, and the crash of tree-boughs
beating against each other.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>When the battle between the Mormons and the Indians
composing the company of Black Eagle was at its height,
Esther Morse was forced to be a looker on. Tied firmly to
her seat in the saddle, with only her hands at liberty and with
her savage captor at her very side, she dared not make a
movement toward escape. But when the strong arm of the
white man had stricken the red one to the earth, and she was
comparatively unwatched, the brave girl gave her steed the
rein, and urging him forward soon disappeared up the valley.</p>

<p class='c010'>So intently had the combatants been playing the game of
blood that no one saw her go, knew of her going, or could
tell when or whither she had flown.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ah! a noble steed was the one that Esther Morse rode
that night, worthy to carry so fair a load. Whirling around
the nearest point of rocks, she paused but long enough to
release her limbs from their bonds and prepare herself in the
best manner in her power for easy horsemanship. Then,
without the slightest knowledge of the road she must travel
in order to gain her friends, she hurried on, striking into a
downward path that she hoped would end in the prairie. The
fear of recapture was greater in her breast than death itself;
so she rode on recklessly over paths that, at another time,
would have made her heart sink and her head turn giddy.
Many a time she looked anxiously back, thinking that she
heard the clatter of pursuing footsteps; then finding that it
was the echo of the hoofs that were so faithfully and swiftly
bearing her on, a faint smile would ripple for a moment over
her face, banishing the stern lines of anxiety and pain. But
these gleams of incipient joy were transient as summer lightning,
for reality stood too near with its stern danger. The
sky was too black, and heavily vailed with clouds, to admit
of the star-light flashing through, unless by chance there
might be parting rifts that permitted a gleam now and then
to reveal how dreary her path was.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Alone in the mountains! Few minds can compass the
meaning of the words, for they know neither of the dangers
or the fears that surround a position so terrible. But that
brave rider was thinking only of escape, and when night and
storm indeed settled around her, she awoke as from a pleasant
dream. The companionship of any one wearing the semblance
of mortality would have been pleasant then, for the
fearful stories she had heard and read came back to her mind
with terrible acuteness, and in each shadow darker than the
rest she saw the form of a wild beast panting for her blood.
There were wild beasts abroad it is true, but the storm that
drove them to their dens and hiding places—the pitiless rain
that drenched her through and through, was her safety.</p>

<p class='c010'>Storm? Yes; for the same lurid glare and terrific thunder
that appalled even Waltermyer was sweeping and crashing
around her. An untrained horse would have swerved and
been dashed to atoms on the ragged rocks hundreds of feet
below—would have missed his footing and plunged down the
gulf, hurling his rider a shapeless mass to the bottom. It
was a terrible ride—terrible for any one, and how much more
so for a feeble girl, lost in the rocky wastes of the inhospitable
mountains and fleeing for her very life.</p>

<p class='c010'>The bridle slipped from her grasp. The cold rain and
numbing atmosphere rendered the hand powerless to hold it
longer, and while the clang of the firmly-placed hoofs fell
hopefully upon her ears in the lull of the tempest, she poured
out her soul in prayer to Him who holds the earth in the
hollow of his hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>Up! still up! Oh! how strangely she has missed her road!
Not to the sloping prairie—not to the level paths, where her
father’s train was camped, did she bend her way, but still
higher—ever higher, toward the dizzy summits where the eagle
builds its nest and seeks no companionship save from its kind.</p>

<p class='c010'>Upward! still upward, where the sure foot of the mountain
goat dare hardly travel, and where the mists hang heavy with
death and chilling dews. Oh! will that rising trail never
end? Will the point never be reached where the foot can
no higher press the flinty road—the winding, serpent-like
course that glides along the frowning wall above and perpendicular
precipice below?</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>A sudden, blinding flash! A glare as if the vail of night
had been rent, and in one unbroken flood let the starry glory
through. Then all was utter blackness! Chilled to the very
heart, unable longer to retain her upright position, she crouches
in the saddle, and bends downward until her long hair, loosened
from confinement, mingled with the milky, wind-tossed
mane of the gallant steed. Her arms clasp his arched neck—she
clings to it for life, and, half fainting, with closed eyes, is
borne along—whither?</p>

<p class='c010'>Whither? The brave horse strains still upon the rocks, but
when, where, will his journey be finished? It is past midnight
and the thunder has ceased. The darkness is terrible,
but the flood-gates of heaven are closed and the drenching
torrent has exhausted itself. Shivering, hopeless, she clings
wildly to that drooping neck with the grasp of one sinking
beneath the swell of a strong tide. She feels her clothes
brushing against the stony walls, and shudders, feebly feeling
that any moment she may be swept off and hurled—whither?
She dares not think—dares not dwell upon her fearful situation.
The thought thrills her with horror. Her only hope
is centered, next to God, upon the rare animal of which she
has so strangely become possessed—upon his keen eye and
sure foot. If he falters—if his foot should chance to fall upon
a rolling stone or fail to span the yawning chasm, then—what
then? She has no strength to picture the horror that would
follow.</p>

<p class='c010'>On! good steed. On! thou desert-born! A priceless
human life is hanging on those firmly-planted hoofs. On!
champion of the prairie, with thy white mane and tail waving
like phantom banners in the darkness. On! There must be
no pause for rest, till that poor shivering creature finds a shelter.
Alone, unguided, horse and rider tread the perilous way,
but with instinct nearly allied to mind, the steed carries his
fair burden patiently, but still upward. There is strength
in his sinewy limbs, and fire in his eyes—swift blood coursing
through his veins and courage in his heart; but beware! The
fiends of death are weaving their spells in the dark valley,—their
stakes are set and toils ready to snare thy unsuspecting
feet.</p>

<p class='c010'>Is it a dream—some phantom of the brain? Can it be that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>she is losing the balance of mind, or is it a joyful reality
that the path becomes more level—even downward, and the
horse steps more surely and promptly, as if a firm hand were
upon the bridle-rein? Intently, thrilled to the very heart’s
core, she listens, but the hollow tramp of the steed alone
greets her ear. Dare she look? Would she see again the
form of her savage persecutor? Was she once more a prisoner?
Alone with him, that red-browed warrior, the Black
Eagle, on the mountain crest, in darkness and midnight?
The thought was death.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes; the course is downward! That much she knows.
But is she still a lonely wanderer? Ah! to solve that question
might well have tired stronger nerves than hers, especially
when stretched as they had been to the utmost tension
by anguish and fear. But, suspense was not to be endured.
Look she did, but without raising her head. She looked and
closed her eyes, shuddering. An Indian was leading the
horse carefully forward! Her worst fears had proved fatally
true; the blackness of the night was as sunshine, when compared
to the terror that seized upon her.</p>

<p class='c010'>An hour of silence—an hour that had been lengthened out
into days by her agony—then her steed halted. A hand was
laid gently upon her shoulder, as if to arouse her. She
sprung wildly to the ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Off!” she exclaimed. “Don’t touch me, for heaven’s
sake, or I shall die!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The night had broken away from the mountains. The
earth was fresh and fair around her. Leafy pine and feathery
hemlock framed the spot on which she was standing, and
dripping with rain, they filled the air with their resinous
odors. Every object was clear to her vision. She took
courage from the growing light, and began to wonder why
the Indian she had so passionately addressed, returned no answer.
She turned toward him—her savage tormentor, whom
her very soul loathed—and saw, not the Black Eagle, but the
proud form and clear, calm eye of the mountain chief, Osse ’o.</p>

<p class='c010'>Something like a smile lurked in the corners of his clearly-cut
mouth, and flitted over his bronzed features. He spoke
to her in the same measured and musical tones she so well
remembered.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>“The child of the pale-face is safe. The <i><span lang="fr">gens du lac</span></i> found
her wandering alone in the mountain.” Inadvertently, perhaps,
he addressed her in the language of the Dacotahs, and
then, as if remembering himself, repeated the words in French,
and perceiving that she understood him, continued:</p>

<p class='c010'>“When the storm was howling its wildest, and the red
bolts were quivering to earth from the bow of the great
Manitou, Osse ’o saw his own white horse flash through the
darkness like the horse that shall bear the warrior when he
has passed the dark valley. Osse ’o’s heart filled with joy,
for he knew the steed at once, and was wandering himself
afoot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I saw you hurled from the precipice,” gasped the
girl, gazing upon the Indian with her strained eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The great Manitou that gives to the eagle wings can keep
his children from harm. The hounds of death were howling
for his blood in the rocky caves below; he was swinging on
a branch as slender almost as the hair which falls from
that head. A white man—one of her own tribe in skin, but
not in heart—raised his fire-weapon, and the bullet hissed
as it passed through his hair.” The Indian removed his otter-cap,
and pointed to a hole in it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good heaven! can this be true? A white man shot at
you when you were swinging over that fearful abyss!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There are black hearts among Indians and white men
alike. It was the sachem of the Lake of Salt.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Mormon! Thank mercy it was none of my people.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The trail has been long, the night cold, and the girl of
snowy skin trembles like a dove when the hawk is swooping
down to wet his beak in her blood.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; I am very, very cold.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“By that tree, scarred and splintered by the forked lightning,
there is a cave. Let her go and rest within it. Osse ’o
will build a fire to warm her limbs, and bring her food. She
must rest. He will watch her while she sleeps.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you are—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A Dacotah!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And the Black Eagle?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will never find her. But she trusts no Indian face, she
fears Osse ’o. He means her no harm.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>“No, I do not; but—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The tongue speaks, but the heart feels.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will trust you, for you have been very kind to me.
Still, you are an Indian, and a stranger.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am a <span class='fss'>MAN</span>!” was the proud reply, and taking her hand,
he led her, unresisting, into the cavern of the mountain.</p>

<p class='c010'>As if touched, insulted, by her doubts, he spoke no further,
but hastily collecting the remnants of a former fire that lay
scattered around the floor, and had been effectually protected
from the storm, he very soon kindled a blaze that was grateful
indeed to the shivering girl. Then leaving her, he hastened
to the thicket and soon returned loaded with fragrant pine-boughs,
and after carefully arranging and covering them with
smaller and softer ones, he motioned her to rest. From
some clear spring near the cave, he brought, in a hastily improvised
cup of leaves, a cool draught, and held it to her lips,
as one would have given drink to a child, for he saw that reaction
was taking place, and her trembling hands almost refused
their office. From a pouch that hung on the wall, he took
dried deer meat and pounded corn, and after boiling the
former carefully, placed it in her lap upon a plate of bark.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My horse,” he said, turning to go.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! forgive me for having doubted you. I was mad
with that fearful ride,” she pleaded, touched to the heart,
not only by the care he had bestowed on her, but by the
truly gentle and respectful manner in which it had been performed,
so entirely different from any thing she had before
seen among the Indians.</p>

<p class='c010'>But he either did not heed or cared little for her words,
for he abruptly left her side, and then, apparently touched by
the tears that had gathered in her eyes, and the sad shadows
upon her face, returned, and almost whispered, in his strangely
thrilling voice:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let the daughter of the pale chief sleep. Let her banish
the black thoughts from her heart. She would go again to
the moving wigwams of her people. It shall be so. But
first she must renew her strength by slumber. The <i><span lang="fr">gens du
lac</span></i> will keep guard, and she may rest safely as if her mother
rocked. When the sun is high, and birds that love the
bright gold of noon are singing their songs of praise to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>good Manitou, then will Osse ’o call her and the trail shall
begin.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thanks, a thousand thanks. Yes; I am very weary.
But my poor, poor father.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There will be joy again in his heart. Sleep! The
herbs of the forest are sweet as the rose-scented gardens of
the East, where the honey-bee wanders and humming-birds
fold their wings in the cups of flowers. Sleep, lady, sleep;
the Wahkan Tanka, the Supreme Spirit of earth, air and
water, ever guards the pure in heart. Sleep.”</p>

<p class='c010'>With these words the Indian left her. She watched his
tall, graceful form as it passed from the cavern, and was
seated at the entrance with the face turned away. Faint and
worn out, she lay down in the couch of fresh pine-branches
and strove to sleep, but wild fancies haunted her tired brain,
and she could not hush them into slumber while the strange
man’s shadow fell across the mouth of the cave. Who could
he be, with the garb of a savage and graceful courtesy which
marks the highest civilization? Truly, he was an Indian, but
with that voice, those gentle words, it was difficult to think
of him as a savage. He had been kind to her as a brother,
and evidently meant her well. Or—her heart bounded again,
as if serpent-stung—could all this be treachery? She put
this idea aside. Then the scene changed and she thought
of her father, of his agony at her loss, of his brave heart but
aged limbs toiling on the mountain trail to rescue her, of his
patient sufferings and utter forgetfulness of self. But again
she looked and saw Osse ’o still seated as before, but with his
head bowed upon his hands. Could he, also, have bitter
thoughts? Did the heart of an Indian ever feel the fierce
passions that cause the sufferings she was enduring?</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, shame! shame!” almost burst from her lips, as she
reflected how nobly he had acted, and then her folded arms
received the aching head, and she softly wept herself to
sleep.</p>

  <h2 id='CHAPTER_XIII' class='c003'>CHAPTER XIII.<br> <span class='c008'>THE DACOTAH’S CAMP—LOVE’S TRIUMPH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Surprised as the Black Eagle was at the escape of his
fair prisoner, he was too free from the superstitions of his
people for any idea that she had disappeared by supernatural
means. But for the certainty that Osse ’o had been
thrown over the precipice by his own hands, to meet a death
which no mortal power could avert, he might have suspected
that singular man of being the agent of her escape; but no
human agency was apparent here. The girl must have extricated
herself in the height of the <i><span lang="fr">melée</span></i>, and urged her horse
off in wild desperation. Ignorant of the trail, she must still
be wandering in the mountains, and to discover and bring
her back was his first business. He waited, however, to see
such of his band as had been wounded properly cared for,
as that was a duty no Indian chief could delay with impunity.
Then, leaving a guard to protect them from the wild
animals that a scent of blood had drawn prowling to the
neighborhood, he gathered up the rest of his force, and took
the backward trail.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was not difficult to find the trail, or, for a time, follow
its windings. But when it had led him into the most intricate
fastnesses of the mountain, the thunder-storm burst out in its
furious wrath, and he stood in the depth of the wilderness
awe-struck and trembling with abject fear. The angry Manitou
was howling fierce wrath upon him for the cowardly murder
he had done. Struck with terror by this idea, the stout warrior
of the forest fell upon his face and shrunk his limbs
together, groveling close to the earth, in dread of the fiery
arrows that came shooting through the leaves, while the
mountain on which he lay reverberated with thunder-bursts.
As every battle-note of the storm swept over him, he clung
closer to the earth, till the eagle-plume on his head was trailed
in mud, and his rich barbarian garments were dripping with
rain. When the telegraph of heaven sent its subtle fluid
athwart the face of the mountain, a cold shiver ran through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>him, and he cried aloud in his wild Indian tongue, pleading
for mercy. His only answer was a fresh burst of thunder,
more vivid gleams of lightning, a wilder turmoil among the
giant forest-trees, which brought him up from the earth in a
fierce panic. When this fresh outbreak of the storm had gone
howling off through the wilderness, he sunk crouching to the
earth again, and in the darkness and drifting rain, blinded,
chilled, and shocked to the soul—a very wreck of savage
pride and  savage  perfidy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Wahkan Tanka is angry with his children,” whispered
a savage, who sat near him. “He has sent the dark-winged
spirits of the evil one to upheave the strong mountains,
and topple down the lofty cliffs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The spirits of the Wahkan Shecha are here!” replied the
Black Eagle, shaking in all his limbs, when a fiercer crash
burst upon their ears, and a tree was splintered and fell in
blazing ruins almost at their feet, lightning-struck, and illuminating
all the rocky points of the mountain.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let the children of the Dacotahs turn back to their wigwams.
The Great Spirit hates the trail their moccasins are
following. He has sent the fire-eyed ones from his giant
wigwam, in the far-off clouds, to warn them,” cried an old
warrior, starting up in the red light of the stricken tree.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When they met the sons of the pale-face in battle,” cried
another, “he turned their arrows aside, made their arms
weak as the little pappoose, and their bow-strings snap like the
dry reed in the breath of the tempest. Manitou is very
angry!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hark!” exclaimed another—for in an hour like that, all
the usual etiquette of the council-fire was thrown aside—the
pipe was left unsmoked, and the wampum-belt was not passed
from hand to hand. “Hark! the chieftains of the Dacotahs
are not deaf. They have ears, and they can hear his
voice as it was in its anger. They are not blind; they can
see the flash of his eye as it lights mountain and prairie with
its red glare. Let them go back again to their homes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” answered the old warrior, stoutly. “When the
sun-spirit smiles again upon the world—when its golden
wings drive the black-plumed ones to their hiding places,
then the foot of the Dacotahs will take the trail. No
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>horse of the prairie, or moccasin of man can keep their footing
in the mountains now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But with the voices of his people in his ears, Black Eagle
shook off his terror. Even in that hour—even in the short
lull of the storm which had followed the lightning-stroke that
shivered the giant pine of the mountain, and scattered the
<em>debris</em> in a fiery storm around them, his black heart aroused
itself, and resumed its wicked purpose. Again he was plotting
treason and weaving crafty spells.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ah, man! man! how vain is all warning to the selfish
and cruel of heart! A moment before, and that wild chief
had cast himself to the earth, aghast at the lightning, and
crouching in fear at the open-mouthed thunder. But the
sky-written lesson of doom passes from his mind while its
fire was yet flaming around him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“See!” whispered one of the warriors to Black Eagle,
“See!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Far down in the valley, but coming noiselessly up the very
side of the mountain, climbing as it were along the bald face,
a snowy object glides. What is it? what can it be? each
Indian asks of the others, for their tongues were fettered by
terror. Surely nothing mortal would be abroad in a storm
like that; and if a human being could be found so desperate
in courage, it was impossible to scale the dizzy cliffs. On—on,
still it goes, dimly visible, ghastly white, unearthly, in
the dim, bluish gleams of lightning. They look again, and
it is gone. Gone even as a smoke-wreath disappears from
before the eye, we know not whither. It was a spirit to the
many—a wandering semblance of something once belonging
to earth. To the Black Eagle, it was the phantom-horse
of his murdered brother, that, killed among the rocks, was
wandering, ghost-like, seeking for his late master. But if this
was so—and his superstitious soul could not shake the belief
off—where, then, was the girl for whom he had ventured and
lost so much?</p>

<p class='c010'>But the wind sobbed itself to sleep, the black clouds were
no more riven by flame, and the earth was left unshaken by
the thunder—the airy fountains had dashed themselves to
spray against the rocks. The world wrapped itself in the
mantle of darkness and slept, still shivering under the storm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>that had passed over it. The solemn silence of the calm followed
the terrific crashing of the tempest, and slumber settled
heavily down upon the travel-stained and weary band
of red-men, whose strength had been exhausted by their fears.</p>

<p class='c010'>Is it true that angels guard us when we slumber, and,
awake, leave us to temptation, and perchance crime? In the
hour of darkness, is there an unseen, unknown power, that
watches by our pillows, blunts the edge of the assassin’s knife,
and turns the glittering steel aside? If such a power there
be, (and who will dare dispute it?) then it kept watch and
ward of the sleeping warriors of the Dacotahs—blood-stained
and merciless as they were, in that almost unsheltered bivouac.
When the weight pressed upon eye and brain, and when the body
was most leaden, there crept into their midst, timidly, and as
that spirit might have taken form had it really watched there,
Waupee, the abandoned wife of Black Eagle. Bitter, indeed,
must have been the passion, and deep the love which
had so long kept her upon the trail of her husband, and
severe must have been the toil she had endured tracking him,
like a sleuth-hound among the winding-paths of the mountains.
Love, fiery love—the one master-passion of an Indian
woman’s life—must have been entirely blotted out, and
all the serpents that lurk among human passions in the hour
of its darkness, must have entered and held triumphant sway
in her savage nature. It is a terrible thing when all the
finer feelings of our nature are thrown broadcast to the winds,
and standing on the verge of the maelstrom of despair, an
immortal soul recklessly plunges into the mad waves beneath,
to be whelmed and lost forever!</p>

<p class='c010'>Groping along in the darkness, with lowly-bent form, and
step light as the snow-flake’s fall, the Indian woman examined
the face and dress of each sleeper. At length she kneels
and touches with gentle fingers the fringed leggins and quill-worked
hunting-shirt of a chief, who lay somewhat separated
from his companions. The garments were dripping with wet,
but she knew them. Then her hands are pressed over her
beating heart, as if to still the wild outcries that struggled for
utterance, or to subdue the terrible pain throbbing there.
Her own fingers had woven the mystic emblems she was
tracing on  the chief’s garments. She had herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>dressed the tough deer skin, embroidered, the curiously-woven
ornaments, colored the gaudy horse-hair fringe—and all for
whom?</p>

<p class='c010'>Memory is busy within her inmost soul now. She sees
a painted wigwam, at whose base the sleeping waters of the
Spirit Lake ripple. The form of one, praised as the beauty
of the tribe, sitting and singing as she weaves the sparkling
beads into designs of grace and beauty. A manly step falls
upon her ear, and her song is hushed, but to drink in far
sweeter music to a maiden’s ear, the words of affection from
the lips of the chosen one who already owns her heart. Then
the happy bridal, and the wild, sweet bliss of a love-marriage—the
resting of a soul fully satisfied—the low cooing of the
dove that has folded its silver wings in its pretty nest, and
pours out heart music all the day long! That was a true
picture of the past—but now?</p>

<p class='c010'>Lower bends the lithe form, until the fringe upon her robe
mingles with that with which she has adorned her once lover.
Even the long locks of her hair, unbraided now, disheveled,
wet and heavy, fall upon his face and startle him. Muttering
in his sleep, he turns on the earth, throwing his strong arms
on either side, and fully exposing the broad breast, heaving
with the deep pulsations of a busy heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>Was there a truer mark for knife or hatchet? Did murder
ever gaze upon a surer target for its venomed shafts?</p>

<p class='c010'>The woman drew back, until all again was still, and then
her cold hand searched that broad chest until she felt the
throbbing heart beneath. Quick as thought, a slender knife
leaps from the concealment of her dress, and flashes like a
silver thread in the gloom. The arm is raised on high, the
form drawn to its perfect height, the lip compressed, and the
nerves braced, and then!</p>

<p class='c010'>Warrior of the wilderness, if around thy path a good spirit
ever flitted—if a white-robed angel ever fanned thy swarthy
forehead, or took thee in its holy keeping, now—<em>now</em>, let it
guard thee from sudden death. Let the broad shield of mercy
be held above thee, and that cruel knife be turned aside in the
hand of thy wronged wife.</p>

<p class='c010'>The poised knife descends, cutting the air like the flash of
a star-beam. It is driven by a desperate hand. Let the canoe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>be waiting on the hither shores of the river of time, to ferry
that savage soul to that farther bank that angels call “here
after.”</p>

<p class='c010'>No, thank God! She was a savage, but could not stain
her innocent hand in blood, wronged though her love had
been. The pure, womanly gold triumphed over the base
alloy of passion. Once she had loved him; once he had been
kind to her; once—it was gone now—all gone; but holy
thoughts of those days came back, and she flung the knife
from her with a shudder, bowed herself beside the sleeping
man, and wept piteously. Ah, triumphant love, undying
devotion! Alike in the civilized and savage soul—the last at
the cross and the first at the tomb.</p>

<p class='c010'>As one suddenly awakes from a fearful dream, that poor,
sorely tried and tempted woman pressed both hands to her
throbbing temples. Then the old deep love surged up
through all her wrongs, and asserted its dominion once more.
All the wild adoration of her heart in other days came back,
baptizing her soul afresh. No, no, she could not murder him
sleeping. That head, lying so dusky and massive in the star-light,
had been pillowed upon her breast. The heart her
knife menaced had beat against her own. He had been kind,
very kind, once. But it was death to her to be found near
him. She refrained from using her power, but would he
prove equally merciful if he awoke. And he was going—whither?
There was madness in that thought. Going to
seek another and a fairer bride—to put her, the true wife, from
his wigwam forever.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bending still lower, softly, gently, as a mother would caress
a sleeping babe, she kissed the full lips, then in silence left the
encampment. It was the last kiss—the last—she should ever
press upon that false mouth. All the world now was utter
darkness to her, the road she traveled uncared for. To flee—flee,
as it were, from herself—was the only object she had in
view. Swift as a hunted deer she dashed down the mountain
side, and away into the wilderness.</p>

<p class='c010'>At any other time, Dacotah as she was, Waupee would
have carefully scrutinized the path, for well she knew that the
gaunt bear of the mountain made his den in the caverns and
hollow trees around her; that the monarch of the fastnesses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>growled his anger when wandering footsteps sounded near his
den, and tore the intruder on his domains piecemeal. She
knew that each step was margined with danger, from the
sliding <em>debris</em> on the narrow path, and pitfalls lurked unseen
to tempt the foot to press the mimic bridge that concealed
destruction. But all fear was swallowed up in one giant
heart-pain, and, half distraught, she rushed along, unthinking,
and heedless of the end. The serpents of despised, cruelly
disdained love, had coiled themselves upon her breast, and
stung it into despair. The full wealth of her wifely affection
had been crushed and flung wantonly aside, trampled ruthlessly
under foot, ground down in the dust, annihilated while yet in
the spring-time of its bloom and fragrance. What was left
for her but death? She had not been nurtured in the schools
of civilized life, which train the lip and eye into smiles, give
false roses for the cheeks and lying words of happiness for the
tongue, when the only music of the heart is a funeral wail.
Poor, uneducated eaglet of the wilderness! Thy pinion had
been broken even when soaring most proudly! The shaft of
the hunter has found thee! Broken-winged and brokenhearted,
what was left for thee but to creep into some lone
cavern and die?</p>

<p class='c010'>The sleep of the party of Black Eagle was long and sound,
but their leader was the first astir. Short time was devoted
to the preparation of food, and shorter still for council.
Night and storm had passed. The glorious morning sun
swept away their somber foot-prints, and those savage hearts
buoyantly lifted themselves out of their fear, and, forgetful of
the stern resolves and penitential promises they had made,
clothed anew with daring, went defiantly forth to battle and
to sin.</p>

<p class='c010'>Most craftily Black Eagle worked upon the minds of his
followers, painting what sweet revenge it would be upon the
white men to repossess themselves of their wandering prisoner,
for wandering, unless dead, she must be. The luring bait of
gold he also held out to them, and was eloquent on the
pleasures of its possession, until, with one accord, his warriors
consented to accompany him, and the march of the rescue
began.</p>

<p class='c010'>Rescue? When the fowler takes the bird or the fisherman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>the spotted trout from the net, is it for rescue? When the
strong-willed and strong-armed man beats back the angry
waves, bears the drowning victim ashore on the rocky heights
of Patagonia, is it for rescue? See! poised on its light wings,
a very spot in the ether, sails the hawk. His slender form is
mirrored in the placid tide below, and his keen eye is watching
for his scaly prey. There is a sudden dart, a plashing of
the water, and a writhing body is torn from its native element,
and borne aloft in the talons of the victor. But see, again!
like an avalanche an eagle rushes through the startled air,
from its lookout on the dry old pine. In mid-air he strikes
the conqueror down. Is not he intent upon rescuing the
feeble fish? Truly, yes, but for what? Earth is everywhere
filled with the answer, and it needs no written words to blazon
the burning shame so often hidden in the single word.</p>

<p class='c010'>Off they go, that dark band of Indian warriors—black
wolves, following on the trail of a wounded doe. Better for
the poor girl they hunted to have perished in the glare of the
lightning, amid the rolling music of the thunder, than meet
them in the hour of their wrath.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='CHAPTER_XIV' class='c003'>CHAPTER XIV.<br> <span class='c008'>WALTERMYER—A CHAMPION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Waal,” exclaimed Kirk Waltermyer, as his good horse
floundered along in the darkness, “of all the rides I ever had
this is the beat. I’ve hearn tell of storms in the mountings,
and thought I had seen them, but they were nowhar compared
to this. Whew! how the wind tussles with the tree-tops and
whistles in the gulches. I tell you, this is some! I’ve half
a mind to camp, and would, only—poor little Est! I wonder
if the rain falls as heavily, and the wind soughs as mournfully
around your grave, my poor gal?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The recollection of his little dead sister, now ever kept in
memory by the name of the young creature he was seeking to
save, humanized and softened his usual rough speech. Still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>he continued, as if addressing a companion who could reply,
and not his faithful horse, with whom his one-sided conversation
was held. And yet, if the doctrine of the transmigration
of souls were true, might not this matchless steed have been
gifted with the keen perception of some great man whose
death the world still mourns? We know the foolish falsehood
of the story, and yet there exist examples in the brute
creation, that, weighed in the scale of worth, would make
many a man shrink into littleness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know some horses, Star,” he continued, “that I wouldn’t
ride across this mountain in a dark night—nary a time. No,
not for all the gold in Shasta. Hello! what kind of a caper
is that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The horse had come to a sudden stop—so sudden as to
shake even his perfect rider, and stood with braced feet, snorting
nostrils, and eyes flashing fire, immovable in limb as if
sculptured from the very rock on which he stood, and yet his
whole body trembling with fear. His keen sight—far more
keen than mortal eye in the darkness—had discovered something
unusual in the path before him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“By heaven!” exclaimed the startled frontiersman, as his
ready rifle was braced against his shoulder, “if it hain’t an
Indian. No, it’s a creepin’, snarlin’ wolf. No, ’tis a b’ar.
No, it hain’t none of them. It’s—by thunder, I don’t know
what it is;” and he swung himself from his horse, and, bending
down, closely watched.</p>

<p class='c010'>That it was something endowed with life he readily
perceived, but what it was he could not make out. Wolf nor
bear ever made those stealthy motions, or crept thus slowly
along. It was very indistinct, and again he raised his
rifle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you be a human, speak,” he shouted; “but if a b’ar or
a cowardly cayote, then I’m arter your scalp, and no mistake.
But no, no; I don’t need it, and such a night is enough to
make beast and man brothers. No, no, I’ll not shoot. Go
your way, and if—as I live by bread and buffalo meat, it’s
gone! I’ve traveled many a long mile in my day, and this
bangs all the other doin’s I ever saw. I do think it was a
human, or”—and he raised his hand to his head, as if to be
certain that his hair would not lift his cap off in terror of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>the thought, and his voice dropped to a whisper—“or it
mought have been a ghost!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, it was a speerit,” he whispered, under his breath;
“a poor, wanderin’ speerit, that can not rest quietly in the
grave. Poor soul—who knows but that it mought come back
again;” and, for the first time during the night, his spurs
touched his horse’s flank, and with a great leap the generous
brute bounded forward.</p>

<p class='c010'>But he could not shake the fear from his mind, and he
who, single-handed, would have dauntlessly rode into the face
of death, now looked anxiously around in the quest of something
that his better judgment told him could not exist.</p>

<p class='c010'>With a feeling of vague terror, Waltermyer still urged his
horse on. He had but one object in view, that was to reach
the topmost cliff, and there, when morning’s dawn transfigured
earth, he could command a boundless view. But the
frontiersman had not a heart or mind to linger on imaginary
danger.</p>

<p class='c010'>Soon the cool breeze swept downward, and wantoned
with his wet hair, and made merry with his draggled garments,
and in its freshness his hardihood returned; even the
strain of an old hunting-song hung upon his lips and struggled
for utterance as he rode along.</p>

<p class='c010'>Clearly above him, through the sharp-cut walls of the cañon,
he soon began to see the stars shine brightly, and, as the
golden light came shimmering down through the leaves, his
way became clear, and he urged his good steed more rapidly
forward. Then came the gray of morning, the hour when
the cloudy waves of night are at full ebb, and stand transfixed,
as it were, with golden arrows for a moment, before the
flood of day comes surging from the eastern ocean. In the
weird semi-light he rode blithely on. A foaming rivulet that
a few hours before had held no drop of moisture rolled before
him. The whole earth was refreshed, and he felt the
glorious influence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come, Star!” he lifted his horse with hand and rein, and
rode boldly in.</p>

<p class='c010'>To the very saddle-bow sunk the horse, as he plunged in
the stream, and the foam-beads danced among his tawny mane
as his feet failed to reach the bottom.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“Come, Star! Come, good horse!” and his manly voice
rang above even the roar of the swollen waters.</p>

<p class='c010'>But spur, and rein, and voice were all needed now, and
when the noble steed reached the opposite bank, it required
all his strength and agility to mount it. His fore-feet rest
upon the shelving, rocky brink—he rears for the leap—he
rises light as a bird on the wing—his hindermost hoofs strike
upon the bank, but the insecure footing gives way—he trembles
like a strong man, struggling against a giant in the wrestling
ring.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come, Star! Once more, my boy!”</p>

<p class='c010'>A giant effort, and a giant leap, and he stands trembling
on secure ground, with the water dripping from his glossy
hide, and the snowy spot in his forehead gleaming from
amid its blackness—a very blazing star, looking out from a
storm.</p>

<p class='c010'>A moment given only to rest, to the recuperation of the
vast energy he has just exhibited, and again that tireless
horse takes the upward trail, without a word or sign from his
master. But his steps are checked. Not that he needed
rest—not that Waltermyer, kind-hearted as he was, and even
more than tender of his favorite steed, had become doubtful
of his strength; but another vision had crossed his track—a
ghost appeared before him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“By—!” but he strangled the oath, and beat back the
impious word, before it could find utterance. “Ef it’s not the
same thing I saw down below! And it is—hold! don’t jump,
for your life! Stop, I say! don’t do it here!” and his horse
sprung, as if gifted with wings, beneath the sharp rowel.</p>

<p class='c010'>Even in the uncertain light, his well-trained eye had discovered
that it was a human being, standing on a rocky shelf
full a hundred feet above him, and preparing to spring from
the fearful height. Who it was he did not pause to think.
Enough for him to know that some fellow-being was in trouble,
and bent on self-destruction. In as many seconds the
swift horse stood on the shelf of rock, and Waltermyer leaped
from its back while in full career.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was an Indian woman, intent on leaping down that fearful
height. Her form was bent, and her arms thrown wildly
upward for the terrible leap, when the frontiersman interposed.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>“By—!” once more the oath was unuttered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, it’s a woman!” he continued, as the form became
limp, and hung heavily in his arms. “A woman, as I live!
May be it’s—” he could not speak the name, but, turning up
the face tenderly, saw in the dim light, not the white girl he
was searching for, but the features of Waupee, the poor heart-broken
wife.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pshaw!” he muttered, in disappointment. “It is only a
squaw;” and then, as if ashamed of himself, he smoothed the
long, black hair from the bronzed face, and after laying the
poor creature carefully on the ground, hastened to the stream
he had so lately passed, and filled his cap with water. Returning
hurriedly, he bathed the upturned face. He was a
rude nurse, but kind-hearted, and there was something in the
utter helplessness of the wretched Indian woman that took a
strong hold upon his rough nature, and exercised an influence
over him a thousand women under other circumstances
would have failed in producing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Waal, she’s real pooty, too,” he muttered, between his
teeth. “The pootyest squaw I ever sot eyes on. Who
would have thought a red-skinned gal could look so much
like a human? But she’s waking up now;” and he seated
himself by her side, looking at her with eyes full of wonder
and pity.</p>

<p class='c010'>Like a frightened fawn, the Indian woman started from the
rock and gazed about her. She had been so suddenly
snatched from the jaws of death, had swooned so deeply,
that, for a time, she was lost to all surroundings, and when
she opened her eyes, it was like one coming out of total darkness
into the glaring light of day. Anxiously, afraid almost,
she gazed about her—at the coal-black steed—the strong form
and face of the frontiersman, and at the cliff beyond. Then,
in all its fearful reality the scene came back to her, and burying
her face in her lap, she sat for a long time speechless,
after the fashion of her people.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My good woman,” began Waltermyer, anxious to break
the silence, and yet doubtful how or where to commence,
“you came mighty near a-fallin’ off the cliff. And now,”
continued Waltermyer, “as soon as you have rested a little
you must git on my horse thar—he’s a good and true one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>and a sure-footed—and I will take you to a place of safety,
if not home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Waupee has no home,” was the sad response.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No home? Waal, I might say the same of myself. But
I s’pose your home is like mine—that is, your tribe’s is—any
whar, whar the night overtakes you. But cheer up; I will
take you to your tribe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Waupee must not go to her tribe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not go to your people? Waal, this beats natur’.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A moon ago there was light in her wigwam—now all is
darkness. Waupee would have given herself to the dark
angels of death. The pale-face saved her and she thanks
him. Once before, when the night was dark, she saw him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Saw me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Like a serpent she crawled across his path.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You did! Waal, I must have took you for a ghost.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The red fiends of murder were in her heart. She was
seeking her husband—who turned her out to die, and—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The infernal brute!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She found him far up in the hills. The sharp knife was
in her hand—her arm was raised—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you could not strike him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She had loved him once.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank God for that!” In the hour of strife, when the
hot blood was rioting through the heart, the frontiersman
could well and willingly fight his way; but to murder a
sleeping man in cold, calculating blood, was a thought that
made him, iron-nerved as he was, shudder and grow faint.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The poor wife he had spurned from his wigwam—the
bride of but little more than one small moon—kissed him as
he slept, and then turned away forever.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That was right—the varmint.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She had nothing to live for. Husband, tribe—all was
gone. What could she do but die?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And so he turned you out—a pooty woman like you, did
he?”</p>

<p class='c010'>For a moment, the black eyes of the Indian woman flashed
upon his, as if to learn the meaning of the flattering words
he had used, but reading sincerity and not unmeaning compliment
in every feature of his face, she replied:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>“He had seen a girl of snowy skin—and carried her away
from her friends to fill his wigwam, and—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hold your horses, thar. A white gal?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fair as the flowers of spring, with hair like the silk of
the maize in the autumn time—eyes like the blue summer
sky—cheeks like the climbing rose of the prairie, and lips
red as the sumac berries, and voice sweet as the music of
spring-waters in the desert.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Whar is she now?”</p>

<p class='c010'>By degrees, he learned the entire history of Esther’s capture—the
wandering—the battle and the escape—all except
the death of Osse ’o, for of that the woman was ignorant—then
his fiery heart burst forth in no measured words. Fierce
were the passions that shook his frame, and bitter would have
been his revenge if the abductors had stood before him. But
even in his wildest torrent of words, there came a controlling,
soul-subduing influence. He murmured, “poor little Est,”
and restraining himself, continued:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I ought to know most of the chiefs at Spirit Lake. Did
I ever meet this Indian?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is known among the Dacotahs as the Black Eagle.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Black devil! Yes, I know him, and a blacker-hearted
fiend never stole horses or murdered peaceful emigrants.
Waal, waal, his time will come. But he’s but an Indian arter
all, and it’s his natur’, I s’pose; but, as for that rascally Elder,
if ever I catch him, I’ll make him think that he’s tied to a
drove of buffaloes, and they are all kicking him at once.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The tongue of Waupee has traveled the trail of truth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe you, gal. Thar hain’t no lyin’ hid in your looks,
like a serpent in the tall sloo-grass. Yes, I believe you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The pale warrior knows all the poor squaw can tell him.
He will follow the trail and the great Manitou will smile upon
him. He was very kind to the poor Indian woman, and she
will never forget him. Now she will go.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Go? Whar in thunder are you goin’ to?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Manitou will guide her moccasins.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you said you had neither home or tribe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She will make for herself a home in the caves of the
mountains, and wait patiently until the death-angel shall
drive away the white-winged spirit of life.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>“If you do, may I be—! Oh, poor little Est!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where then shall she go?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Go? Why with me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The chiefs of the pale-face will laugh at their brother for
being kind to a woman of the Dacotahs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That hain’t the safest kind of business, I can tell you, but
I don’t care for their laughin’. My shoulders are broad, and
can carry a pretty big load.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But they will look black on Waupee—will laugh at her
wrongs, and trample her heart in the ashes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let them do it ef they dare! Let any one, even if he
war my brother, that is, ef I had one, try to crush or hurt
the feelin’s of a poor creature who has been so trampled upon,
and Kirk Waltermyer will teach them a lesson they will
remember longer than any thing they ever larned at school.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The pale-face has been very kind, and the daughter of
the Dacotahs will not see him insulted for her sake.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, you just a-hear. I honor you for your feelin’s, and
like you for your speerit, but I don’t go one step without you.
So thar! Ef you have made up your mind to camp here
until doomsday, why, I’ll pitch my tent too, and Star with
me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Has the pale-face thought of what his tribe will say?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tribe be—blessed. Don’t frown, little Est, for that’s no
swearin’. I hain’t any more of a tribe than you have, so
just make up your mind to come along quietly like a good
girl, and I’ll soon show you that Kirk Waltermyer has a heart
that beats like a trip-hammer, and always in the right place.
He hain’t any more given to braggin’ than one of your warriors;
but if anybody even dares to question about you, they’ll
find you have got one friend that hain’t to be easily handled.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Waupee will go with the pale-face for a time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Waal, I reckon it will be a long time onless you find
some better place to camp in than these desolate mountings.
Here, Star,” and he whistled his faithful horse to his side.</p>

<p class='c010'>Star came up ready for action. When Waltermyer had drawn
the girths tighter and arranged both bridle and saddle to his
liking, he lifted the light form of Waupee from the earth
before she had the slightest intimation of his intention, and
swung her upon the back of the horse with as little difficulty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>as if she had been but a feather’s weight. The hot blood
welled up into cheek, brow, and neck of the woman, and
shone ruddy even through her bronzed skin at the action.
But the calm face of Waltermyer satisfied her that all with
him was perfect kindness and good faith, before even his
words had reached her ear.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thar now, you’ll ride like a princess—though I don’t well
know what they may be. Onyhow, you’re not a-goin’ to
walk, while I own a horse. I know the braves, as they call
themselves in your tribe, make you go on foot while they
strut off on thar horses all fiery-fired to death. But I don’t
and won’t! Thar’s no use a-talkin’, it’s just what Kirk Waltermyer
would do for any woman.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When the pale-face tires, Waupee will walk.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tires? Waal, ef that isn’t about the richest thing I ever
heard. When I tire!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But the horse will grow weary. The trail has been a
long one and the night stormy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My horse grow a-weary? Waal, that’s equil to the other!
When he gits tired I’ll take you in my arms, for not a single
step shall a woman walk on such a trail as this, while Kirk
Waltermyer draws breath;” and he laid his strong hand on
the rein and led the way down the mountain.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bitter crimination followed the Mormon leader after his
engagement with the Indians, but fortunately for him, no lives
had been lost, else, in the passion of the hour, even his supposed
sacred character would scarcely have preserved him
from punishment at the hands of his followers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It ain’t no use, Thomas,” (he had dropped the “Elder,”)
“in talking any more about it. I shan’t for one go poking
about in these hills after a girl that none of us care about.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But hear me, brother,” interposed the Elder.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, now, fire away with them. I don’t think the curses
of a man that goes around stealing other folks’ children can
hurt a man much, anyhow. Come, boys, who’s a-going with
me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>A large portion, the greater part in fact, drew away from
the Elder and gathered round their champion.</p>

<p class='c010'>The horse of the self-appointed leader of the dissenting party
was turned with his last word, and he started down the
mountain path. A few only remained behind, but they, one
by one, departed also.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thomas turned his horse’s head toward the scene of the
late affray, and, after passing the night crouched low among
the rocks where the awful majesty of God was written on the
sky in the blazing lightning and spoken in the bellowing
thunder, he safely reached it just as morning was shaking
roseate light from its glorious wings.</p>

<p class='c010'>Morning, in all its splendor, was abroad. The mist cleared
away, and the dense fog disappeared from the valley. A
boundless prospect was opened to the searching eye of this
bad man. In the far-off prairie, he could see the train of his
people winding slowly along—miniature men and cattle and
wagons. Wondering at his absence, they journeyed on. He
could see the pine-trees bowing their lofty crests, and whispering
to the wind a thousand feet below. But vainly he sought
for a trace of the red-man. A tiny smoke, a single curling
ribbon of thin, blue vapor rose before his vision—a slender
spiral coil of azure floated softly from the earth, and soon lost
itself in the clouds. The dry wood, always used by the red-man,
gave forth these delicate traces of smoke, and he followed
its guidance. But what if he should encounter Black
Eagle and his troop of savage warriors when angry with
defeat? He still carried more gold about his person, and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>would buy their favor; but might it not, also, be a tempting
bait for his own murder? Strangely woven, indeed, was the
web of his thoughts, and he was half tempted to sacrifice
every thing and return to his followers. He looked after them
with this purpose firmly planted in his heart; but the long
train of white-covered wagons had disappeared in the distance,
and, almost sadly, he again pressed forward.</p>

<p class='c010'>A huge black timber wolf, the most savage of all the monsters
of the mountain, crossed his path—stopped for a moment,
and gazed upon him with bloodshot, fiery eyes and snapping
jaws. The Elder raised his pistol and fired. The swift-winged
ball cut a shallow furrow, and the beast bounded,
howling, away, while up the crags and into the caverns
leaped the report. There was more than one wolf traveling
that path—more than one searcher after innocent kids. The
many were the wolves of nature—the one that of unbridled
passion.</p>

<p class='c010'>The wounded beast sought its bone-strewed lair to brood
in darkness over its pain. The pistol had been truly aimed,
but its effects had proved far more fatal upon the man who
fired it than on its intended victim. His horse sprung at the
report, reared high, bounded upward with a desperate plunge,
and threw the careless rider among the bushes that lined the
narrow trail. Then, freed of his burden, and exempt from
all controlling influences, he darted wildly down the mountain,
his iron-armed hoofs ringing upon the flinty rocks, from
which they sent forth a stream of flashing sparks.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Mormon arose uninjured, and gazed wildly around
him. Now he felt utterly alone!</p>

<p class='c010'>Shaken in every limb—the victim of a double accident by
his reckless horsemanship, and with his garments still wet
and stiffened from the storm, he was forced to clamber up the
rocks as best he might, with the dark shadows of coming evil
gathering thickly around him. Weapon, save the one now
partially discharged, he had none—the other was in the holsters;
of food he had not a single mouthful, for the scanty
remnant of his stores was also tied to his saddle. If he could
not find the Indians—if his strength should fail him, he must
abide that most horrible of all deaths—starvation!</p>

<p class='c010'>The smoke that had lured him onward—where was it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>now? No trace of it was upon the air, as far as the eye could
reach.</p>

<p class='c010'>Still on he toils. The sun rises hot and blinding. Its fiery
rays, concentrated in the prison-like opening of the cañon, fall
with intense fury upon his head. The very rocks appear
molten beneath his feet; and as he struggles on, almost bewildered,
a burning thirst seizes him—a living flame is kindled
in his vitals. Faint—fainter—yet still on! Is death
coming on him now? Will the black buzzards feast upon
him, and wild wolves wrangle for his bones? Like the miraculous
outgush of water which leaped forth from the cleft rock
smitten by the prophet, a crystal fountain came leaping from
the hollows of a cliff just before him—leaping joyously over
its shelf of mossy rock, and sending up its spray, shimmering
in the sunshine like a network of golden lace.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Elder crept to the base of the rock, over which this
current leaped, and kneeling down, drank of its cool tide as
it rushed off to a neighboring ravine, and lost itself among
tangles of fern and forest-shrubs. The cool draught appeased
his raging thirst, and he looked about more hopefully. He
stood upon one side of a rocky hollow, into which the torrent
dashed its waters, troubling them with flashing beauty.
A little way off, on the broken edges of the basin opposite,
a serpent, glittering in all its native splendor of burnished
green, and red and gold, raises its crest, and looks on him
with its glittering eyes. Man and reptile alike had tasted the
waters. The one steals slowly away, rustling on its winding
trail—a thing of fear, but innocent in its desires; while the
other starts back in terror, and slowly resumes his uncertain,
dangerous way.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='CHAPTER_XVI' class='c003'>CHAPTER XVI.<br> <span class='c008'>THE HOMEWARD TRAIL—THE STRANGE MEETING—FOEMEN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Esther Morse slept long and refreshingly. When she
awoke, a single glance at the form seated still at the entrance
of the cavern brought all the circumstances of the present
back to her mind, and she arose, flinging aside the heavy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>hunting-shirt with which the Indian had protected her from
the chill.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The daughter of the pale-face has slumbered well,” said
the Indian, rising and coming toward her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, oh! how much I have to thank you for—and you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When the maiden slumbers the warriors keep watch.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you robbed yourself of your garments to protect me.
How very, very kind.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The red-man is accustomed to the cold breath of the
mountains and does not feel it,” said the Indian, turning away.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hunger is a rare luxury after all. The researches of
Ude or Soyer have never found any thing to rival it. No
<em>epicurean</em> dainties can match the exquisite pleasure found in its
gratification. A night in the mountains, drinking in the very
breath of life—the pure, clear, bracing air—a breakfast hot
from the glowing embers and a draught of water from the icy
brook, are worth more than all the exquisite dishes that ever
man invented. It needed no urging, therefore, for the girl
to satisfy the cravings of her keen appetite. In after years
she might feast from silver and crystal spoons on tables groaning
with costly luxuries, but that delicious breakfast from the
rude brick plate—the smoking venison, and the ruddy flakes
of the spotted trout—the mountain bivouac and the mountain
appetite—was never to be equaled in her life again.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Esther had completed her repast, Osse ’o stood leaning
against the entrance of the cave—the rocky pilaster that
upheld the giant but irregular rustic arch above, and listened
to the story of her captivity. Briefly, at his request, she gave
the painful particulars, for it was necessary that he should
know them in detail in order to form his future plans. A
lightning flash of the eye—a stern compression of lips—a
sudden swelling of the thin nostril, and a heaving of the
breast, alone betrayed the indignation that was passing within.
His figure remained as motionless as the rock against which
he leaned.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The sun is well up and the streams have run themselves
low—the leaves are dry and the moss no longer slippery,”
was his response, when she had concluded, without in the
slightest manner alluding to what he had just heard. “Osse ’o
knows well what trail the white man will travel.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>“But my father—my dear, dear, father!” exclaimed the
girl. “He could not have followed me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The trail of the daughter must be straight as the crow
flies to the moving wigwams of her people. When she is in
safety, Osse ’o will find her father—or die.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Die? oh! not that. You have been so kind—so like a
brother to me. Surely there is no danger to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The way may be long and the trail winding. When the
girl of the pale-faces is ready, we will go.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ready? Now, this instant. Come, I have no fear.” She
placed her hand in his as she spoke, and smiled as he clasped
it in his hard palm.</p>

<p class='c010'>For a single moment only the Indian held it in his tight
grasp, then he uplifted it slightly as if he would have raised
it to his lips, but with a grave sadness in his eyes he checked
the impulse, slowly releasing his grasp, and turned toward his
horse that stood ready prepared for the march. He offered
her his foot as a step from which she could mount the horse.</p>

<p class='c010'>What a game of living cross-purposes was playing then in
the mountains? Waltermyer, a white man, had become the
protector and guide of an Indian woman. Osse ’o, a Dacotah,
was performing the some services for a white girl. Black
Eagle and his followers were hunting for Esther, and the
Mormon seeking for them. All traveling, in reality, blind
paths—pursuing the end of a trail that was shifting every
hour—seeking each other as a baffled man might search for a
name written in sand on the sea-shore.</p>

<p class='c010'>With his hand upon the bridle-rein, the Indian walked
almost by Esther’s side, cheering and guiding the horse. When
the narrow trail caused her to shrink back from the dizzy
brink on one side until she brushed the perpendicular wall of
rocks on the other—when the descent became steep—when
the path was cumbered with loose stones—when an overhanging
branch threatened to sweep her from the saddle—when
the rocky bed of the <i><span lang="es">arroya</span></i> was deep and the current strong—when
more than usual danger lurked around her in any
form, he pressed still nearer, warned her of the danger in deep,
earnest whispers—whispers whose undertone was more like
the lower notes of a flute than a human voice—and held her
firmly with his strong arm.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>All that is beautiful in human tenderness was concentrated
in these guarding cares. In her gratitude and her admiration,
Esther forgot every thing which might have revolted her at
another time.</p>

<p class='c010'>“See!” said Osse ’o, as he paused to breathe his steed for a
moment. “Far off toward the setting sun are your father’s
wagons—the pale-man’s traveling home. Like little rifts of
snow they lie whitely in the distance.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So near? Let us hurry on. Each moment seems a lifetime
till I reach my father.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The trail winds round the mountains like a serpent, and
even this good horse must rest. Within an arrow’s shot
below, though it takes miles to reach it, is a huge rock level
at the top. A thousand warriors could camp upon it, and
yet find room for more. There I will build a fire and rest.
Then Osse ’o will guide the girl of the pale-faces to her
father.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Without giving her an opportunity to reply, he led the horse
rapidly forward until they reached the plateau he had briefly
described.</p>

<p class='c010'>To the very center of this camping-ground, where it abutted
against an abrupt precipice of immense height, he led the
horse and assisted her to dismount. The wide table-rock
lay stretched before them in every direction; he had chosen
this position because he could not be suddenly attacked while
occupying it, nor could an enemy approach undiscovered.
There was no danger of an ambush or surprise there. After
freeing his horse from his equipments, that he might browse
freely, he commenced preparation for the noonday repast.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hardly however had he gathered the light wood, a task in
which Esther, glad of exercise after her tedious ride, blithely
assisted, when the sound of a horse coming down the path on
the opposite side from which they had entered upon the rocky
plain startled them, and while the girl fled to the concealment
of the bushes, Osse ’o hastily snatched his arms and prepared
to defend her. A cheerful, ringing voice followed the hoof-tramp
they had heard.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come, old feller, don’t be going to sleep. A half-a-dozen
rods further, and you can roll in clover. Whew! it has been
an orful long trail though. Come on and—” here the speaker
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>came in full sight of the plateau as he spoke. Instantly changing
both his manner and his voice, he continued:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ef thar hain’t one of them blasted red-skins! I only
hope it’s that cus—blessed Black Eagle! Maybe thar won’t
be a scrimmage then,” and his rifle was at his shoulder.
“By thunder, I know that are horse; it’s the only one I ever
saw that could range with my black. Hullo! Show your
hand, stranger—friend or foe?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Indian dropped his rifle, and holding out his hand, palm
foremost, in token of amity, slowly advanced.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ef you’re the rightful owner of that horse, you must be
Osse ’o.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you Waltermyer!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just as true as shootin’. Give me your hand, old chap.
Here, Waupee, jump down, it’s all friendly. I didn’t know
at first but that there mought be a chance of a fight, but it’s
all right now. But I say, Osse ’o, what in the name of goodness
brought you here?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let my brother wait and look,” and proceeding to the
bushes, after a very brief explanation to Esther, Osse ’o led
her forward.</p>

<p class='c010'>Waltermyer dashed forward and grasping the hand of the
white girl, shook it with enthusiastic warmth, exclaiming in
his deep, trumpet-like voice:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just speak one word, beauty. Just say that your name
is Esther and I’ll be happy as you please.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That certainly is my name. But why do you want to
know?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come here, Waupee;” and he lifted the Indian from his
horse’s back and placed her by the side of the white girl.
“There you are; now get acquainted.” The two females
greeted each other kindly, while the happy frontiersman was
stripping his good steed and shouting:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Three cheers for you—and you—and all of us. I know
the hull story, Osse ’o, and so do you, I suppose, only I can’t
surmise how you came to be here, any more than you can
how I got to the shelf. Come, gals, stir about and let’s have
a little somethin’ to eat. I am as ravenous as a b’ar in the
spring-time; more’n that, I want to git down on the perarer
where it’s smooth sailin’ before sun-down.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Ready hands make quick work; and it was not long before
that strangely-arranged quartette were seated upon the low
rock, satisfying their hunger. Not much time did it require
either for them to be fully conversant with the history of each
other’s wanderings and meetings.</p>

<p class='c010'>The tramp of a horse startled the whole party at last.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What in thunder is up now?” shouted Waltermyer,
snatching his rifle and springing to his feet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Mormon!” replied Osse ’o.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Black Eagle!” whispered the Indian woman; and seizing
Esther by the hand she almost dragged her into the concealment
of the bushes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Twin devils!” exclaimed Waltermyer, loosening his pistols
in his belt ready for instant service, and whistling to his
horse he drove him back toward the perpendicular rocks.</p>

<p class='c010'>No further words issued from the already compressed lips
of the Indian; but after he had, also, placed his horse by the
side of black Star, he took his position near Waltermyer and
awaited the issue that was forced upon them.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was silence long enough for the heart to throb scarce
a score of times, and then, at the same instant, Black Eagle
rode upon the plateau from one side, and the Mormon entered
on foot from the other.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='CHAPTER_XVII' class='c003'>CHAPTER XVII.<br> <span class='c008'>A DUEL IN THE WILDERNESS—A STARTLING REVELATION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Thus the savage and the Elder met, man to man, on equal
terms, the Indian only having an advantage in the possession
of his horse. Waltermyer and Osse ’o had succeeded in securing
their horses, and retreating behind an abutment of the
rocks, waited for the stormy interview which was sure to follow
the contact of these fiery spirits.</p>

<p class='c010'>Black Eagle rode close to the Elder with a reckless dash,
that threatened to trample him under the hoofs of the half-wild
steed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where is the young pale-face?” he questioned, stooping
his plumed head, and hissing forth the words in a half-whisper.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>“That is the very question I wish to ask you,” replied the
Elder.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When your white-faced warriors crept like serpents among
our braves and fired on them, she escaped,” answered the
chief, sullenly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, that is, so far, your loss—no, not yours, for I have
paid you well, and you know where the girl is. Take me to
her hiding-place, or give back my gold.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Does the pale-face think the Black Eagle a fool?” answered
the chief, with a cold sneer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know that I was one, to trust an Indian with money,”
was the reply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There was no trust. You gave the Dacotah gold, and
he carried off the daughter of the pale-face from her father’s
tent. He brought her, under a guard of warriors, to the
mountain. Black Eagle had snared the bird; why did you
not take her while she was fluttering in the net?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A pretty question, on my soul! Take her, when your
men fought like so many devils.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will the pale-face pay the Dacotah his gold?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What gold, you cormorant?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did not he promise him plenty of yellow-dirt, when the
white squaw should be given up?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; but you lied. You concealed her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Whose tongue is it that speaks of treachery? The pale-face
was false alike to his own tribe and that of Black Eagle.
Go up on the mountain and look. The warriors speak angrily,
their wounds are fresh. Had the tongue but traveled the
trail of truth, there would have been no mourning and blackened
faces in the wigwams of the Dacotahs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is nothing to the purpose. Will you either give
me back my gold, or produce the girl?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The gold that the white man asks for is hidden where
no eye but that of the Black Eagle can ever find it. If the
false medicine of the tribe at Salt Lake wants the maiden of
the snowy skin, let him find her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The passions of these bad men were rapidly getting the
better of their judgment. Each knew, by this time, that the
other was playing a desperate game, and watching for some
advantage. The Indian was resolved upon revenge, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>securing the gold he knew the other had about him, and the
Mormon felt that he was in a position of terrible peril.</p>

<p class='c010'>While these two treacherous men stood glaring at each
other, Esther Morse cowered in the undergrowth, panic-stricken
by the sight of her mortal enemies. Waupee stood
by her, pale, stern, and with glittering eyes, like a statue of
bronze.</p>

<p class='c010'>Waltermyer and Osse ’o stood behind a sheltering cliff that
jutted, tower-like, on the plateau lapping over the face of the
rocky wall, watching the scene with great indifference; both
these men were too brave for any thought of peril to the
woman they protected.</p>

<p class='c010'>Esther Morse grew frightened as the two angry men moved
nearer the place of her concealment, and starting up suddenly,
placed her foot on a fragment of rock, in order to flee back
into a more secure concealment. Her foot slipped, and she
fell forward with a low cry.</p>

<p class='c010'>Black Eagle know the voice, for he had heard its shrieks
of pain before.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Traitor! Out of my way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let the pale-face beware! The blood of the warriors
of the Dacotahs cries aloud for vengeance. The thirsty
earth is drunk with it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It required all the strength and influence of Waltermyer, to
keep Osse ’o from interfering.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s a fair fight,” said the frontiersman; “they are nothing
but infernal reptyles anyhow. No, no; let them fight it out,
for brutes as they are. It’s b’ar and wolf-hound; who cares
which whips?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Mormon still advanced, intent only on seizing his
prey; but the Indian spurred his horse between him and the
thicket where Esther was concealed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Black Eagle strung his bow, and placing the feathered shaft
upon the well-strained string, drew it deliberately.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Die, fool!” was the sneering response, and the report of
the revolver awoke the echoes of the rocks.</p>

<p class='c010'>“By heaven!” exclaimed the excited Waltermyer, forgetting
his usual caution, as the horse of the Indian fell backward
in his death struggles, for the bullet had missed the
human form, and buried itself in the heart of the beast. “By
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>heavens—forgive me, poor little Est, I couldn’t help it; but,
the noblest brute of the party has fallen before the coward
shot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the work of a moment for the active red-man to
free himself from his steed, for even while he was falling, he
had swung himself clear, and sent an arrow in return for the
shot. For a moment the revolver pealed and the bow-string
snapped, but without fatal effects, though both combatants
were wounded. At length the pistol charges were exhausted,
and the frayed, overstrained string of the bow broken, and
the combatants mutually paused, glaring at each other.</p>

<p class='c010'>The lull in the storm of battle was only for a moment, for
the Indian hurled his keen hatchet full at the head of the
Mormon. Fortunately, the aim had been hurried and uncertain,
for it missed its intended mark, and shivered to pieces
on the rocky floor of their battle-ground. The discharged
pistol was still in the hands of the white man, and the Indian
had his knife. In physical strength they were about evenly
matched, but the Black Eagle had much the advantage in the
training of his wild life.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now the fun is comin’,” whispered Waltermyer. “Thar
they go like Kilkenny cats.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But think of their lives,” replied Esther, for the first time
speaking.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Think what would become of you, if either of them got
thar hands on you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But it’s horrible!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pshaw! Thar lives ain’t of any more ’count than a
sneakin’ cayote.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Indian woman sat with bowed head. She knew well
that the man she had loved so passionately was engaged in a
desperate encounter, but though there might have been something
of that former love yet lingering around her heart, the
education of a lifetime rendered it a duty to restrain her
feelings. It was not for a woman to take part in the strife
of warriors.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hand to hand the fight was renewed. It was a series of
rapidly executed movements. To strike and guard—to
advance and retreat. But few were the injuries inflicted, and
when, at length, the blade of the knife was broken upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>barrel of the pistol, and that weapon fell from the hand of
which it was the sole defense, they stood with only the arms
that nature had given them, bloody and fatigued.</p>

<p class='c010'>From a long-protracted struggle the Indian rose, reeling
with the loss of blood, and, staggering forward, he snatched
his bow from the rocky floor, restrung it with his trembling
fingers, and then groped, half blindly, around until he had
secured the broken knife. Enough apparently remained for
his purpose, for, kneeling, he attempted to sharpen it, and a
smile of terrible meaning fitted athwart his dark face, as he
felt of the edge. He regained his feet, and staggered up to
the fallen white man. He twined his fingers in the long
hair, wet already with the damps of death, and raised his
arm on high. Esther Morse turned her head away with
horror. Osse ’o involuntarily raised his shield, but Waltermyer
burst through all restraint, and dashed forward, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c010'>“By the light of heaven, you shall not scalp him! A
cussed, treacherous reptyle as he was, he was yet a white
man, and shall not be butchered.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet, quick as Waltermyer’s movements had been, Osse ’o
glided in before him, and Waupee, breaking through all bonds,
followed, leaving the white girl alone.</p>

<p class='c010'>Black Eagle heard them coming. He turned upon them,
and met the man, whose intended murder lay on his soul,
face to face. With a fierce cry he loosened his hold upon the
Mormon, and tottered toward the verge of the cliff. Then,
a true woman still, the discarded wife dashed forward to save
him with an outcry of passionate despair. She was too late.</p>

<p class='c010'>For a moment, long enough to fix his arrow on the string,
he retained his footing, sent the shaft, even in his death
agonies, flying through the air, and, with the death-song of
the Dacotahs ringing from his lips, fell backward into the
dark valley.</p>

<p class='c010'>Waltermyer, busy in examining the body of the Mormon,
to see if any thing of life remained, had not seen the action.
He was intent only on the dead man before him, for the spirit
had passed to its final accountability.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Waal, waal,” he said, almost pitifully, for, with death, all
his feelings changed, “I never knew any good of you, and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>for a white man, you were most onacountably undesarvin’.
But I reckon you must have had a soft spot in your heart,
somewhar, and I’m sorry now that I didn’t kinder take care
of you. It was onnatural, that’s a fact. But I saved your
scalp, anyhow, and that’s some comfort. More ’an that, it
shan’t be said that I left you without a grave. No, no, I’ll
take good care that you don’t lie here, for the wolves to snarl
over. Osse ’o, Osse ’o, I say; whar are you, man?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Waltermyer started to his feet, in sudden terror, for the
usually musical voice was changed into a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s the matter with you, man?” he questioned, as he
saw that the lithe steps of the red-man had grown slow and
unsteady. That the flashing eye was dim, and that both
hands were pressed upon his side, as if to still some great
pain.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing, nothing. Don’t tell the daughter of the pale-face,”
was the whispered reply, and Osse ’o fell into the outstretched
arms of Waltermyer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“By heaven! if there is not an arrow stickin’ in his side.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A shriek rung from the bushes, and Esther Morse sprung
to his side and knelt down by the wounded man, while
Waupee, with the nimble and soft fingers of an Indian, used
to such occurrences, was busy unfastening the garments.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t! don’t!” came struggling from the ashy lips of the
sufferer. “Let me die.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I do, may I be shot,” exclaimed the frontiersman, and
his strong hands quickly tore away the fastenings.</p>

<p class='c010'>“By heaven! It’s a white man!” he shouted. “No red-skin,
but just as white as your’s, gal. Look and see!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Waupee carefully drew out the arrow-head and stanched
the blood.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is a hunting-arrow, not a poisoned one for war,” he
continued, as she held it up to Waltermyer.</p>

<p class='c010'>Esther saw the white shoulder glowing from under the torn
hunting-shirt, and knew, with a thrill of joy, that the man
whom she had so long taken for a Dacotah was of the same
complexion as herself. Even then she remembered the
situation in which she had been placed with him, and her
cheek, neck and brow burned again. Ah! how well she
remembered many an act and word, thought but lightly of at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>the time, that now identified his claim to birth and education;
but she had no time for these thronging fancies. Would he
live? A fervent prayer went forth from her heart, then
nerving herself for the task, she strove to assist in dressing the
wound. Gently, but firmly, she was repulsed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The children of the Dacotahs,” murmured Waupee, “are
learned in the ways of the medicine. The hand of the pale-face
is like the aspen-leaf in the breath of the storm, and her
heart is faint as the dove.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But, will he live?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Life is the gift of the great Manitou.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, yes; don’t trouble your pretty heart about it, beauty,
he’ll soon be around again,” exclaimed Waltermyer, holding
the wounded man in his powerful arms, and bearing him to
the shade of the bushes, tenderly as a mother would have carried
her first-born.</p>

<p class='c010'>Waupee succeeded in stanching the blood, and then, from
the neighboring woods, gathered healing herbs, and carefully
bound them on the wound, while the white girl lifted Osse ’o’s
head from the hard rocks, and pillowed it in her lap. Waltermyer
departed for the woods, and after a long absence, returned,
bringing with him pine-branches and curving strips
of bark, sufficient to make a shelter, and these, in the hands
of Waupee, soon were framed into an almost fairy-like bower.
When Osse ’o fell asleep, in his fragrant shelter, Waltermyer
sat smoking his pipe at the door of the lodge, silently at first,
but, ere long, his restless spirit broke forth in words:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Waal; I did the best I could for the Mormon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You buried him, then?” asked Esther, solemnly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, deep and well. I piled the stones up, so as to know
the place again ef I ever should see any of his relations, and
they wanted to find it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Indian woman—the poor, brutally-abused und suddenly
widowed wife—looked steadily at him with her large,
black eyes, but said nothing. Waltermyer fully understood
the look, and replied:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, yes, Waupee, I did the same for the Black Eagle.
Perhaps neither of them would have done it for me; but I
can’t help that. I made him a grave for your sake, and fixed
it up, Dacotah fashion, down by the spring. I knew their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>customs, and thought every one of the tribe would like to add
a stone to the pile when they passed; so I fixed it in just as
handy a place as I could.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A look of fervent gratitude passed over the face of the
widow; then arising, solemnly, she covered her face in her
hands, and slowly walked away. Esther would have accompanied
her, but Waltermyer laid his hand on her arm, and
whispered:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let her go alone. To-night she will watch by the grave.
It’s a part of their religion, I allow. And now you go to
sleep, while I watch.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I! He watched me when I slept last night; why
should I not do the same for him when he so much needs my
care?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Waal, it’s woman’s business to take care of the sick, I
s’pose; but you don’t look over strong. Thar hain’t many
roses a-blossomin’ on your cheeks, but they will come again
in time; and you couldn’t take care of a braver or a better
one, if you war to search the world over.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know him, then?—tell me his history.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Waltermyer obeyed her, and revealed all that he knew of
the wounded man.</p>

<p class='c010'>The night passed, and with it all apparent danger; for now
Osse ’o was able to sit up and converse.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why does Waupee stay so long?” asked Esther, whose
true womanly heart had sorrowed deeply as she thought of
the Indian widow sitting by that lonely grave in the dark
hours.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will go and see,” replied Waltermyer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And I, if our patient can spare us for a moment,” said
Esther, with a smile that would have amply repaid the semi-Indian
for a far more dangerous wound.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” was the whispered response. “I have known her
well; she was a very queen for goodness, virtue, and truth
among the Dacotahs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They found the Indian widow stretched upon the grave of
her late lord and master. They thought that, worn out with
suffering and watchfulness, she had cast herself down to sleep;
and so she had. The poor woman had fallen into that sleep
which knows no waking. She had passed from earth calmly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>and apparently without a struggle, for no traces of pain lingered
on the pale-face—upturned, as if looking to the blue
heaven above. With a broken heart she had followed her
husband to the happy hunting-grounds, faithful even in death.
By his side she was buried; and as the kind, tender-hearted
frontiersman piled the last stone upon the rude monument
that was to mark her grave, his eyes filled with tears, and
he hoarsely whispered:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Poor woman! May she be happier in heaven than she
ever was on earth. I didn’t think I should ever have cried
over a red-skin; but thar’s no use in denyin’ it now, and if
she had lived. Waal, waal, she’s at rest.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In sorrow and sadness of heart they returned to the plateau.
In the freshness of that dewy morning, with Osse ’o again
mounted on the snowy steed, for Esther would have it so,
herself mounted on “Black Star,” and Waltermyer walking
silently forward, they left the mountain and the lonely graves,
never to tread again those rocky and dangerous fastnesses.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='CHAPTER_XVIII' class='c003'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br> <span class='c008'>HOME.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>A swift ride through the prairies brought Esther Morse
with the two horsemen who had proved a sure escort, into
her father’s camp. Two days and a night they had journeyed
on from the mountain where Black Eagle and his wife lay
sleeping. Danger is to love what the hot-house proves to a
delicate plant—its blossoms spring into quick, vivid life, with
little regard to time.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the little party rode into Morse’s canvas settlement,
there was no Indian in the group; yet the number was
exactly the same as when it left the mountain—three, and no
more. Osse ’o was there in his rich, savage dress, his noble
person unchanged, but his complexion had grown fair,
and in his eyes you saw the brooding tenderness with which
young La Clide had regarded the first lady of his love.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Never had the grand passion changed a man as Osse ’o was
changed after he knew how near Esther had been to forgiving
the savage character he had assumed. His disgust of
civilized life died a gentle death; his taste for prairie adventures
disappeared. He was the betrothed husband of Esther
Morse; the bereaved father had only recovered his child to
give her away again.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was settled that the party should turn back from the
Oregon trail, and seek the first white settlement where the
marriage ceremony could be performed. Morse sent his followers
on their way, made wealthy by the property with
which he had intended to open a new settlement. So with
wagons well crowded with stock and tents, the train moved
one way, while the few persons in whom we are most interested
retraced their steps toward civilization.</p>

<p class='c010'>At Laramie a quiet marriage service made Esther Morse
the wife of young La Clide. To this point Waltermyer had
accompanied his friends. Perhaps he had intended to leave
them there; but if so, his great heart failed him; and he
journeyed on in their company till school-houses and steeples
ceased to be a novelty to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>They reached the bank of the giant Missouri, where its
turbulent tide rushes grandly into the “father of waters.”
The boat that was to bear them away was already puffing at
its wharf, when the father and husband wrung the hand of
Waltermyer, and tendered a home with them in exchange for
his prairie life.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no!” he replied, in a voice husky with emotion; “my
place is out on the perarer thar. I shouldn’t be happy in
the settlements; thar may be more work for me to do. No;
but I thank you for your kind offers, and shall not forget
them. Good-by. I didn’t ever think my eyes would be wet
agin,” and he turned as if to depart.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Waltermyer, my kind friend—”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the voice of the young bride, and he turned again:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Waal, Miss?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am going to ask a favor of you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A favor of me? Waal, you shall have it. Ask me for
any thing in natur’, just my life even, and it’s yours.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you take care of my horse until I return?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>“Will I?” and a smile brightened his bronze face. “Will
I? Would a bee stop to suck honey from a clover-top?
But you don’t mean to part with him for good? You can’t
mean that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We are going on a long journey, you know. Some one
must take charge of him until our return. You will not refuse
me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>A shrill whistle was his only answer. Both horses came,
forming a striking contrast. Snow-Drift, with his snowy
skin and silver mane, and the black, with his banner-like tail,
the white spot shining in his forehead like a crystal star.</p>

<p class='c010'>Good-by! The steamer, with its living freight, dashed
oceanward; and Waltermyer, accompanied by his tried companion
La Moine, hastened again to the broad prairies and
the rocky cañons of the Nevadas.</p>

<p class='c010'>A year passed rapidly to the voyagers, in, to them, strange
lands. Their eyes rested on the castellated towers of “merrie
England”—their feet wandered among the crags, and they
listened to the merry songs of Switzerland—they roamed amid
the vineyards of France—and grew sad among the ruins of
imperial Rome. Then, with hearts and minds filled with the
beauties of past ages, came the thought of their native land.
Home—peerless to the long absent! Home—the sweetest
thought and the dearest word of earth.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ocean was recrossed. The lithe spars had bent to the
snowy canvas, the rainbow flag floated from the fore, and
through the placid waters the swift-winged keel glided, as if
all the good spirits of ocean had gently pressed it on with
watery fingers.</p>

<p class='c010'>The mansion of Claude La Clide had been refitted more
sumptuously than ever. The grounds had grown more luxuriant—shrub
and tree were laden with June blossoms, and the
bright air heavy with perfume. Many a curiously fastened
box had arrived, for La Clide and his wife, both lovers of the
beautiful, had purchased lavishly in their wanderings, and
expectation was on the <em>qui vive</em>, in the neighborhood, to learn
what all the signs of preparation could mean.</p>

<p class='c010'>A wandering group of girls had paused at the gate before
the long-deserted mansion, during an early evening walk, and
stood looking up the tree and flower shaded and walled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>avenue, commenting upon the beautiful scene. One young
girl of the group, at least, looked upon the stately dwelling
with bitter—bitter feelings. She was thinking of the time
when she had a right to come and go within that mansion,
almost as its mistress. In the foolish pride and evil passions
of her reckless youth, she had crushed the flowers of a manly
love into the dust, and so lost every thing. Oh, how bitter—what
wormwood and gall, in such an hour like that, were the
simple words, “It might have been.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Worthington—Ellen,” said a gentleman, as he joined
the group, “have you heard the news?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I? Assuredly not, if it is news.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I am glad to be the first to tell it you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is it so very interesting?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To you I should think it would be.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a marked emphasis on the words, and a hidden
meaning in them, intended for her ear alone. She turned
pale, and looked at the speaker sharply. It was the man who
had tempted her to play the coquette with the owner of that
princely establishment, who, in his turn, had trifled with her,
and now stood ready to enjoy her anguish.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Me? You speak in riddles, sir,” she faltered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, then, I will be plain. Claude La Clide has married
a rich and beautiful wife, either in England or France, I
forget which, and will be home with her to-night. It is time
they were here now, I fancy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Married! married!” gasped the girl. “Well, sir, what is
that to me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was bitter—bitter cruel that she should be so humbled
by the very man for whom she had so basely used her once
noble lover. Before she could move away, or recover composure,
a cloud of dust announced the approach of a carriage.
On it came, glittering in the slant sunbeams, drawn by richly
caparisoned horses, that fretted against the curb in their high-blooded
vitality. Within were seated a middle-aged man, a
younger one, whom the group recognized at once, and a
woman, whose calm, sweet loveliness struck them with admiration.
On they whirled, through the broad entrance of the
chestnut avenue. The dust from the wheels almost crushed
that pale girl, as they whirled by, falling on her as unheeded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>as it fell on the crouching stone lions keeping ward at the
gate. Like an angel driven from a second Eden, she turned
away. He had not seen her—never would look upon her
again with love lights in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>The lady moon rose high in the heavens, and the golden
stars flung their braided rays to earth. The flowers breathed
fragrance from their chaliced lips. The trees sung a melodious
lyric, and the voice of the river came stealing to their ears,
softened by distance, like the deeper notes of a wind-swept
harp.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the balcony of La Clide’s dwelling the master and
mistress stood, watching the moonlight shimmering down
upon the waves, and drinking in the entire loveliness of a
scene few countries could equal.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, how beautiful! And this is our home!” whispered
the wife, as if her voice—and a sweet one it was—could disturb
the fairy-like panorama before, above and around her.
“How much more beautiful than any thing we saw even in
Italy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, there are few scenes that can match it in any land.
To me it has every charm, dearest.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, truly. Every thing is so more than beautiful it
could not be otherwise. No wonder you speak of a charm.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you not feel it? Does not your heart thrill with it?
Is not your mind full of it? Ah, yes, I see you understand
me now. It is—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Home, Osse ’o—La Clide—husband, it is <span class='fss'>HOME</span>!”</p>
